HOLDING NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS CARRIES EXCHANGE RATE AND OTHER TYPES OF RISK. THE VALUE OF NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS MAY BE DERIVED FROM THE CONTINUED WILLINGNESS OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO EXCHANGE TRADITIONAL GOVERNMENT CURRENCY FOR DIGITAL REWARDS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE POTENTIAL FOR PERMANENT AND TOTAL LOSS OF VALUE OF A PARTICULAR DIGITAL REWARD SHOULD THE MARKET DISAPPEAR. THE VOLATILITY AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE PRICE AND VALUE OF NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS, RELATIVE TO GOVERNMENT CURRENCY, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. NERD UNITED DEV1 DOES NOT AND CANNOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THE VALUE OF ANY NFT, DIGITAL REWARD OR BLOCKCHAIN, INCLUDING THE NERD UNITED DEV1 BLOCKCHAIN AND NERD UNITED DEV1 REWARD, AND EXPLICITLY WARNS THE USER THAT THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY NFT, DIGITAL REWARD, OR BLOCKCHAIN REWARD WILL INCREASE IN VALUE, AND THAT THEY MAY HOLD NO VALUE, DECREASE IN VALUE, OR ENTIRELY LOSE VALUE.\r\nGeneral Terms and Affirmation: These Terms and Conditions constitute the User Agreement and Terms of Service (hereafter the “Terms & Conditions” or this “Agreement”) between Nerd United Dev1 (also referred to as “Nerd United Dev1”) and any person, customer, or entity (referred as the “User”, “You,” “Your,”) utilizing the website, dev.nerdunited.net1 (hereafter the “Site”), Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain, and any blockchain-based products, features and services provided thereon as defined below (“Nerd United Dev1 Services”). These Terms & Conditions do not create any agency, partnership, or joint venture between Nerd United Dev1 and User. By signing up for an account through Nerd United Dev1 or any Nerd United Dev1 owned websites, APIs, or mobile applications, the User has read and consents to these Terms & Conditions. The User also agrees to Nerd United Dev1’s Privacy Policy. These Terms & Conditions may be amended and updated from time to time at the sole discretion of Nerd United Dev1. Revised versions will be considered effective as of the date and time posted on the Nerd United Dev1 Site. Your access to or use of the NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES or Site indicates your acceptance of these Terms & Conditions. You are agreeing to use the Site and the NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES at your own risk.\r\nTerms found in this Agreement that relate to the NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES or Nerd United Dev1 content, features, or functionality that are not available in your home jurisdiction are not applicable to you unless and until they become available to you. Certain NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES available to you in your home jurisdiction may not be available to you when traveling outside of your home jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nUSER AFFIRMS HE/SHE IS OVER THE AGE OF 18 OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE THE USER RESIDES IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, AS THE NERD UNITED DEV1 APP AND NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER AGE 18 OR THOSE THAT HAVE NOT REACHED THE AGE OF MAJORITY.\r\n1. NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES.\r\nNerd United Dev1 Services include the facilitation of a distributed application operable with a decentralized blockchain network, using smart contracts (each a “Smart Contract”) to enable Users to own, buy, sell, transfer, and share unique digital rewards that can be visualized on the Nerd United Dev1 Site and/or through the NERD UNITED DEV1 APP. To use the Nerd United Dev1 Services, a User needs compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (depending on the Nerd United Dev1 Service). The Nerd United Dev1 Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.\r\n1.1 Nerd United Dev1 Node.\r\nThe Nerd United Dev1 Node is a computer software system functionally connected to the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain. The Nerd United Dev1 Node supports blockchain work by maintaining the cryptography and confirming transactions facilitating recordation and validation thereof on the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain. (“Nerd United Dev1 Node Verification”) “The Nerd United Dev1 Node supports the blockchain by maintaining the cryptography, confirming transactions, and performing other functions for the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain”. It is foreseeable that at the option of the User, the Nerd United Dev1 Node may be recommissioned by the User to support other blockchains or other technologies. Used herein, “Nerd United Dev1 Node” may represent either the node itself or a license the User obtains to run the node. The Nerd United Dev1 Nodes when combined form the “Nerd United Dev1 Node Network.” Owners of Nerd United Dev1 Nodes can earn LACE1 Digital Rewards by operating their nodes in accordance with automated algorithmically driven Smart Contracts conforming with provisions of a distributed governance framework (“DGF”) set forth and initiated in a charter ratified by a community of owners of Nerd United Dev1 Nodes comprising the Nerd United Dev1 Node Network and corresponding to the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain.\r\n1.2 Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain.\r\nThe Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain allows each user to log digital items, characters, non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) digital rewards, and other attributes on the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain public ledger that allows for decentralized, immutable record of ownership. When a User purchases, earns, or receives any NFT or digital reward through a Smart Contract process, the User owns completely and outright the digital reward. For the avoidance of doubt, the User acknowledges and agrees that while the User may own an NFT or digital reward, the underlying embedded intellectual property rights may be subject to certain licensing requirements, and the only way such rights can be conveyed to Users is if the associated conveyor holds a valid license to the intellectual property and conveys the same. If such license terminates, the conveyor, and by extension the User, may not have any rights to the underlying embedded intellectual property in the User’s NFTs or other digital assets, and the underlying embedded intellectual property may be changed or removed at the rights owner’s determination.\r\n1.3 Nerd United Dev1 Reward.\r\nEach User of any service on the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain and associated Nerd United Dev1 Node may be able to earn the Nerd United Dev1 Digital Reward, which may or may not be bridged to other blockchains (including but not limited to Ethereum) through a minting process solely at the option and action of the User. The Nerd United Dev1 Digital Reward is a digital reward and not a security token. Nerd United Dev1 Digital Rewards are not being offered to investors and there is no Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to promote Nerd United Dev1 Digital Rewards. Like BTC (which is the digital reward generated from the Bitcoin Blockchain), the Nerd United Dev1 Digital Reward is created through a unique blockchain protocol. Its utility may reside solely within the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain and may or may not have value. Nerd United Dev1 Digital Reward is not available for purchase from Nerd United Dev1. Moreover, Nerd United Dev1 cannot, and does not, control whether any of the Nerd United Dev1 Digital Reward, any NFT, and any other digital reward has monetary value on any other blockchain. On the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain, the Nerd United Dev1 Site, the Nerd United Dev1 App, or any website or application associated with the Nerd United Dev1 Services, neither the Nerd United Dev1 Digital Reward, nor NFT, nor other digital reward may be exchanged for currency. Nerd United Dev1 Digital Reward is a digital reward earned in exchange for work and action on the Nerd United Dev1 Node network. Nerd United Dev1 Digital Reward is designed to have utility on the Nerd United Dev1 platform for the purchase of Nerd United Dev1 products and services. Nerd United Dev1 Digital Reward is not an investment product and may never have any value. Nerd United Dev1 node owners should not expect to recognize any value from Nerd United Dev1 Digital Reward other than its utility within the Nerd United Dev1 Platform ecosystem. Nerd United Dev1 does not anticipate Nerd United Dev1 Digital Reward’s value correlating with Nerd United Dev1’s business activities.\r\n1.4 Nerd United Dev1 App\r\n1.4.1. Nerd United Dev1 will provide each User with a Nerd United Dev1 App to serve as the User’s wallet. Nerd United Dev1 will never take custody or control over any digital rewards stored in a User’s Nerd United Dev1 App. The Nerd United Dev1 App does not store, send or receive any NFT or digital reward, but such transactions occur directly on the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain or other supported blockchains. Instead of the Nerd United Dev1 App, the User may use any compatible digital app or wallet provided by a third-party company that safely connects to the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain. A User may be able to use the Nerd United Dev1 App or other compatible wallet to send and receive digital rewards with other users of the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain. Nerd United Dev1 does not offer any User the ability to exchange one form of currency for any other form of currency (fiat or digital). Nerd United Dev1 App is not a custodian, exchange or money transmitter.\r\n1.4.2. When a User creates a Nerd United Dev1 App, the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain software generates a cryptographic private key and public key pair that the User must use to send and receive any digital reward supported on the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain. The User is solely responsible for storing and keeping secret, outside of Nerd United Dev1’s Services, a backup of any User’s Nerd United Dev1 App credentials, private key(s), passwords, and transaction information that the User maintains in the Nerd United Dev1 App or otherwise with the NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES. It is recommended that User backup its Nerd United Dev1 App. If the User does not backup the Nerd United Dev1 App, the User may not be able to access the Nerd United Dev1 App in the event that Nerd United Dev1 discontinues some or all of the NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES. Any digital reward a User has stored within its Nerd United Dev1 App may become inaccessible if the User does not know or keep secret its Nerd United Dev1 App keys and passwords. Nerd United Dev1 does not receive or store a User’s app passwords, PIN, keys, network addresses or transaction history. Nerd United Dev1 cannot assist any User with app password or key retrieval. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of a User’s credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase, app identifier, password, or keys) can dispose of the Digital reward in the User’s app.\r\n1.4.3. For a transaction to be validated on the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain, any Nerd United Dev1 transaction through the Nerd United Dev1 App must be confirmed and recorded in the distributed ledger associated with the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain. The Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network supported by the users of the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain, which is not owned, controlled or operated by Nerd United Dev1.\r\n1.4.4. Nerd United Dev1 has no control over digital rewards generated through the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain, and cannot ensure that any transaction details a User submits via the NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES and Nerd United Dev1 App will be confirmed or processed on the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain. The User agrees and understands that the transaction details submitted by the User via the NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES and Nerd United Dev1 App may not be completed or may be delayed by the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain or any supporting blockchain used to process the transaction. Nerd United Dev1 does not guarantee that the Nerd United Dev1 App can transfer title or right in any NFT or digital reward, and Nerd United Dev1 makes no warranties of title of any kind. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain, Nerd United Dev1 cannot assist the User to cancel or otherwise modify such transaction or details.\r\n1.4.5. In the event of a fork of the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain or any other supported blockchain, Nerd United Dev1 may not be able to support the User’s activity related to Nerd United Dev1 or any other supported NFT or digital reward. The User agrees and understands that in the event of a fork of the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain, any transaction associated with the Nerd United Dev1 App or NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES may not be completed, may be partially completed, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. Nerd United Dev1 is not responsible for any loss incurred by any User caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a fork of the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain.\r\n1.4.6 Nerd United Dev1 does not currently charge a fee for the Nerd United Dev1 App, receiving, sending, or storing NFT (when available) and digital rewards. However, Nerd United Dev1 reserves the right to do so in the future, and in such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to the User incurring such fee. Notwithstanding, the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain may have Blockchain Transaction Fees required to transact digital reward transactions through the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain. Nerd United Dev1 may attempt to calculate for the User any Blockchain Transactions Fees, though such calculation may be inaccurate or excessive. The User may select a greater or lesser fee, and the User is solely responsible for paying any Blockchain Transaction Fees required on the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain. Nerd United Dev1 will neither advance nor fund any Blockchain Transaction Fee on any User’s behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.\r\n1.4.7 The User shall be responsible for all activities that occur through the NERD UNITED DEV1 APP and accepts all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to the Nerd United Dev1 app, to the maximum extent permitted by law. The User represents and warrants that the User is familiar with and accepts the risks associated with digital apps and private keys, including the risks described herein.\r\n1.4.8. From time to time, there may be programs in place to allow User to receive a reward, in the form of Nerd United Dev1 Reward, NFT, or otherwise, based on actions taken by the User, whether it be by referral or other program in place at the time (“Additional Rewards”). User understands that Nerd United Dev1 makes no representations or warrants regarding the Additional Rewards. Notwithstanding or limiting the foregoing, Nerd United Dev1 further makes no representations or warrants surrounding the operation of any NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES or that said NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES/Additional Rewards will be error-free or uninterrupted. User accepts the sole responsibility for taking any and all actions to obtain any Additional Rewards, and holds Nerd United Dev1 harmless for any opportunity cost or losses that occur as a result of the non-receipt of anticipated Additional Rewards, monetary or otherwise.\r\n\r\n2. PAYMENT TERMS.\r\nYou can use the NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES for free or for a charge, either of which is a “Nerd United Dev1 Transaction.” Each Nerd United Dev1 Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Nerd United Dev1 and/or you and the entity providing the Nerd United Dev1 Service as contracted by Nerd United Dev1. Nerd United Dev1 will charge your selected payment method for any Nerd United Dev1 Transaction that requires payment. If your chosen payment method cannot be charged for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we may attempt to charge you again or request that you provide another payment method. Unless otherwise provided, all Nerd United Dev1 Transactions are non-refundable and final.\r\n2.1. Annual License and Monthly Service Fees.\r\nThe User shall pay a one-time Nerd United Dev1 Node license fee and the then-current monthly service fee(s) for NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES. Nerd United Dev1 or any of its affiliates or third parties may be the party that sells the software or hardware for any Nerd United Dev1 Node.\r\n2.2. Software License.\r\nThe User may be required to enter into a software license agreement with Nerd United Dev1 or any third party for the use of any required software for each Nerd United Dev1 Node. The User shall pay all associated software license fees.\r\n2.3. Maintenance and Hosting Fees.\r\nNerd United Dev1 does not maintain or host any Nerd United Dev1 Node, but may refer the User to one or more third-party hosting companies that may or may not be affiliated with Nerd United Dev1. If the User elects and is part of a separate hosting agreement, the User may be required to pay certain data center operations, maintenance and power fees (“Maintenance Fees”). These Maintenance Fees may be deducted from the User’s digital rewards or Nerd United Dev1 Reward with the consent of Nerd United Dev1, at Nerd United Dev1’s discretion. Users are responsible for any reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by User resulting or arising out of the User’s election to use a third-party hosting company.\r\n2.4. Blockchain Transaction Fees.\r\nThe delivery and receipt of any of the User’s digital rewards through the Nerd United Dev1 App may be subject to network or transaction fees charged by the blockchain associated with the User-selected algorithm (“Blockchain Transaction Fees”), which are non-refundable. Blockchain Transaction Fees are paid to emit, record, verify, and process a transaction on the blockchain. Any withdrawal or transfer of the User’s digital rewards may be subject to Blockchain Transaction Fees.\r\n2.5. Other Third-Party Fees.\r\nCertain digital apps, app addresses, tools, and third-party software and devices (“Third-Party Fees”) used by the User may also charge the User a fee, including a per transaction or transfer fee, which are non-refundable. The User is responsible for satisfying any such fee(s).

Nerd United Dev1 and User recognize that from time to time amendments will be made to the Nerd United Dev1 Node Network distributed governance framework (DGF). Nerd United Dev1 and User both specifically agree that Nerd United Dev1 may, in the future, present the Nerd United Dev1 Node Network with proposed amendments (the “Proposed Amendments”) that the Node Network will then vote on whether to implement or not (the “Governance Vote”). The User understands that the Proposed Amendments will be made at the discretion of Nerd United Dev1, and Nerd United Dev1 owes the User no duty or obligation to make proposals in User’s best interests. The User specifically understands that there may come a time when Nerd United Dev1 proposes an amendment that is (i) not in or(ii) in direct opposition to the User’s best interests, financial or otherwise (including, but not limited to a change in the distribution protocol), and the User has no legal recourse against Nerd United Dev1 should any Proposed Amendment be approved and implemented through the Governance Vote. The User’s only recourse is to vote against said Proposed Amendment. Nerd United Dev1 and the User both agree that one such Proposed Amendment maybe to change the specifications, including, but not limited to the internet connection, Random Access Memory, Central Processing Unit requirements, extra space, and any other requirements needed to run the Nerd United Dev1 Nodes (the “Specifications”). Nerd United Dev1 and User further agree that while the Specifications may be minimal on the effective date of this Agreement, this is subject to change through the Proposed Amendment and the Governance Vote. Nerd United Dev1 does not and cannot represent or covenant that any rewards earned (financial or otherwise) for running a Nerd United Dev1 Node are not subject to change.\r\n\r\n6.

DISCLOSURES & RISKS\r\n8.1 Notification. Nerd United Dev1 notifies each User of certain disclosures and risks associated with blockchain NFT and digital rewards and their associated technology and protocols. NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES are not an investment product, and no action, notice, communication by any means, or omission by Nerd United Dev1 shall be understood or interpreted as such. Nerd United Dev1 has no influence whatsoever on the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain, the transactions and consensus protocols, or the NFTs or digital rewards, including the Nerd United Dev1 Reward. Ownership of a Nerd United Dev1 App or Node or the use of NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES does not represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security, debt or equivalent right, or any right to receive any future revenue or form of participation in or relating to any blockchain or digital reward, including the Nerd United Dev1 Blockchain or Nerd United Dev1 Reward.\r\n8.2 Digital Rewards. Digital rewards are not considered legal tender, are not issued or backed by any government, and have fewer regulatory protections than traditional currency. Moreover, digital rewards are not insured against theft or loss by any insurance corporation or any investor protection, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.\r\n8.3. Regulatory Risk. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual NFTs, digital rewards, and blockchain rewards. The regulatory status of digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact the NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that any of the above are regulated financial instruments that require registration. Nerd United Dev1 may cease any distribution of any of the above, the development of the Nerd United Dev1 App, Node, or other Nerd United Dev1 platform or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so. The industry in which Nerd United Dev1 operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental, quasi-governmental, regulatory or other similar types of (including banking) authorities will not examine the operations of Nerd United Dev1 and/or pursue enforcement actions against Nerd United Dev1. Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting Nerd United Dev1 in particular. All of this may subject Nerd United Dev1 to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause Nerd United Dev1 to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain blockchain-based products or services, all of which could harm Nerd United Dev1’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the NERD UNITED DEV1 SERVICES.\r\n8.4 Technology Risk. Virtual NFT and digital reward transactions may be irreversible and losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some virtual transactions are deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which may not necessarily be the date or time the user initiated the transaction. The nature of such virtual transactions may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attacks.\r\n\r\n9. DISCLAIMER\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Nerd United Dev1, ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
