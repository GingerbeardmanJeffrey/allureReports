HOLDING NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS CARRIES EXCHANGE RATE AND OTHER TYPES OF RISK. THE VALUE OF NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS MAY BE DERIVED FROM THE CONTINUED WILLINGNESS OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO EXCHANGE TRADITIONAL GOVERNMENT CURRENCY FOR DIGITAL REWARDS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE POTENTIAL FOR PERMANENT AND TOTAL LOSS OF VALUE OF A PARTICULAR DIGITAL REWARD SHOULD THE MARKET DISAPPEAR. THE VOLATILITY AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE PRICE AND VALUE OF NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS, RELATIVE TO GOVERNMENT CURRENCY, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. NERDUNITEDDEV DOES NOT AND CANNOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THE VALUE OF ANY NFT, DIGITAL REWARD OR BLOCKCHAIN, INCLUDING THE NERDUNITEDDEV BLOCKCHAIN AND NERDUNITEDDEV REWARD, AND EXPLICITLY WARNS THE USER THAT THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY NFT, DIGITAL REWARD, OR BLOCKCHAIN REWARD WILL INCREASE IN VALUE, AND THAT THEY MAY HOLD NO VALUE, DECREASE IN VALUE, OR ENTIRELY LOSE VALUE.\r\nGeneral Terms and Affirmation: These Terms and Conditions constitute the User Agreement and Terms of Service (hereafter the “Terms & Conditions” or this “Agreement”) between NerdUnitedDev (also referred to as “NUD”) and any person, customer, or entity (referred as the “User”, “You,” “Your,”) utilizing the website, dev.nerdunited.io (hereafter the “Site”), NerdUnitedDev Blockchain, and any blockchain-based products, features and services provided thereon as defined below (“NUD Services”). These Terms & Conditions do not create any agency, partnership, or joint venture between NUD and User. By signing up for an account through NUD or any NUD owned websites, APIs, or mobile applications, the User has read and consents to these Terms & Conditions. The User also agrees to NUD’s Privacy Policy. These Terms & Conditions may be amended and updated from time to time at the sole discretion of NUD. Revised versions will be considered effective as of the date and time posted on the NUD Site. Your access to or use of the NUD SERVICES or Site indicates your acceptance of these Terms & Conditions. You are agreeing to use the Site and the NUD SERVICES at your own risk.\r\nTerms found in this Agreement that relate to the NUD SERVICES or NUD content, features, or functionality that are not available in your home jurisdiction are not applicable to you unless and until they become available to you. Certain NUD SERVICES available to you in your home jurisdiction may not be available to you when traveling outside of your home jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nUSER AFFIRMS HE/SHE IS OVER THE AGE OF 18 OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE THE USER RESIDES IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, AS THE NERDUNITEDDEV APP AND NUD SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER AGE 18 OR THOSE THAT HAVE NOT REACHED THE AGE OF MAJORITY.\r\n1. NUD SERVICES.\r\nNUD Services include the facilitation of a distributed application operable with a decentralized blockchain network, using smart contracts (each a “Smart Contract”) to enable Users to own, buy, sell, transfer, and share unique digital rewards that can be visualized on the NUD Site and/or through the NERDUNITEDDEV APP. To use the NUD Services, a User needs compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (depending on the NUD Service). The NUD Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.\r\n1.1 NerdUnitedDev Node.\r\nThe NerdUnitedDev Node is a computer software system functionally connected to the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain. The NerdUnitedDev Node supports blockchain work by maintaining the cryptography and confirming transactions facilitating recordation and validation thereof on the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain. (“NerdUnitedDev Node Verification”) “The NerdUnitedDev Node supports the blockchain by maintaining the cryptography, confirming transactions, and performing other functions for the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain”. It is foreseeable that at the option of the User, the NerdUnitedDev Node may be recommissioned by the User to support other blockchains or other technologies. Used herein, “NerdUnitedDev Node” may represent either the node itself or a license the User obtains to run the node. The NerdUnitedDev Nodes when combined form the “NerdUnitedDev Node Network.” Owners of NerdUnitedDev Nodes can earn IZE Digital Rewards by operating their nodes in accordance with automated algorithmically driven Smart Contracts conforming with provisions of a distributed governance framework (“DGF”) set forth and initiated in a charter ratified by a community of owners of NerdUnitedDev Nodes comprising the NerdUnitedDev Node Network and corresponding to the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain.\r\n1.2 NerdUnitedDev Blockchain.\r\nThe NerdUnitedDev Blockchain allows each user to log digital items, characters, non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) digital rewards, and other attributes on the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain public ledger that allows for decentralized, immutable record of ownership. When a User purchases, earns, or receives any NFT or digital reward through a Smart Contract process, the User owns completely and outright the digital reward. For the avoidance of doubt, the User acknowledges and agrees that while the User may own an NFT or digital reward, the underlying embedded intellectual property rights may be subject to certain licensing requirements, and the only way such rights can be conveyed to Users is if the associated conveyor holds a valid license to the intellectual property and conveys the same. If such license terminates, the conveyor, and by extension the User, may not have any rights to the underlying embedded intellectual property in the User’s NFTs or other digital assets, and the underlying embedded intellectual property may be changed or removed at the rights owner’s determination.\r\n1.3 NerdUnitedDev Reward.\r\nEach User of any service on the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain and associated NerdUnitedDev Node may be able to earn the NerdUnitedDev Digital Reward, which may or may not be bridged to other blockchains (including but not limited to Ethereum) through a minting process solely at the option and action of the User. The NerdUnitedDev Digital Reward is a digital reward and not a security token. NerdUnitedDev Digital Rewards are not being offered to investors and there is no Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to promote NerdUnitedDev Digital Rewards. Like BTC (which is the digital reward generated from the Bitcoin Blockchain), the NerdUnitedDev Digital Reward is created through a unique blockchain protocol. Its utility may reside solely within the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain and may or may not have value. NerdUnitedDev Digital Reward is not available for purchase from NUD. Moreover, NUD cannot, and does not, control whether any of the NerdUnitedDev Digital Reward, any NFT, and any other digital reward has monetary value on any other blockchain. On the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain, the NUD Site, the NerdUnitedDev App, or any website or application associated with the NUD Services, neither the NerdUnitedDev Digital Reward, nor NFT, nor other digital reward may be exchanged for currency. NerdUnitedDev Digital Reward is a digital reward earned in exchange for work and action on the NerdUnitedDev Node network. NerdUnitedDev Digital Reward is designed to have utility on the NUD platform for the purchase of NUD products and services. NerdUnitedDev Digital Reward is not an investment product and may never have any value. NerdUnitedDev node owners should not expect to recognize any value from NerdUnitedDev Digital Reward other than its utility within the NUD Platform ecosystem. NUD does not anticipate NerdUnitedDev Digital Reward’s value correlating with NUD’s business activities.\r\n1.4 NerdUnitedDev App\r\n1.4.1. NUD will provide each User with a NerdUnitedDev App to serve as the User’s wallet. NerdUnitedDev will never take custody or control over any digital rewards stored in a User’s NerdUnitedDev App. The NerdUnitedDev App does not store, send or receive any NFT or digital reward, but such transactions occur directly on the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain or other supported blockchains. Instead of the NerdUnitedDev App, the User may use any compatible digital app or wallet provided by a third-party company that safely connects to the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain. A User may be able to use the NerdUnitedDev App or other compatible wallet to send and receive digital rewards with other users of the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain. NerdUnitedDev does not offer any User the ability to exchange one form of currency for any other form of currency (fiat or digital). NerdUnitedDev App is not a custodian, exchange or money transmitter.\r\n1.4.2. When a User creates a NerdUnitedDev App, the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain software generates a cryptographic private key and public key pair that the User must use to send and receive any digital reward supported on the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain. The User is solely responsible for storing and keeping secret, outside of NUD’s Services, a backup of any User’s NerdUnitedDev App credentials, private key(s), passwords, and transaction information that the User maintains in the NerdUnitedDev App or otherwise with the NUD SERVICES. It is recommended that User backup its NerdUnitedDev App. If the User does not backup the NerdUnitedDev App, the User may not be able to access the NerdUnitedDev App in the event that NUD discontinues some or all of the NUD SERVICES. Any digital reward a User has stored within its NerdUnitedDev App may become inaccessible if the User does not know or keep secret its NerdUnitedDev App keys and passwords. NUD does not receive or store a User’s app passwords, PIN, keys, network addresses or transaction history. NUD cannot assist any User with app password or key retrieval. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of a User’s credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase, app identifier, password, or keys) can dispose of the Digital reward in the User’s app.\r\n1.4.3. For a transaction to be validated on the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain, any NerdUnitedDev transaction through the NerdUnitedDev App must be confirmed and recorded in the distributed ledger associated with the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain. The NerdUnitedDev Blockchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network supported by the users of the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain, which is not owned, controlled or operated by NUD.\r\n1.4.4. NUD has no control over digital rewards generated through the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain, and cannot ensure that any transaction details a User submits via the NUD SERVICES and NerdUnitedDev App will be confirmed or processed on the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain. The User agrees and understands that the transaction details submitted by the User via the NUD SERVICES and NerdUnitedDev App may not be completed or may be delayed by the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain or any supporting blockchain used to process the transaction. NUD does not guarantee that the NerdUnitedDev App can transfer title or right in any NFT or digital reward, and NUD makes no warranties of title of any kind. Once transaction details have been submitted to the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain, NUD cannot assist the User to cancel or otherwise modify such transaction or details.\r\n1.4.5. In the event of a fork of the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain or any other supported blockchain, NUD may not be able to support the User’s activity related to NUD or any other supported NFT or digital reward. The User agrees and understands that in the event of a fork of the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain, any transaction associated with the NerdUnitedDev App or NUD SERVICES may not be completed, may be partially completed, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. NUD is not responsible for any loss incurred by any User caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a fork of the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain.\r\n1.4.6 NUD does not currently charge a fee for the NerdUnitedDev App, receiving, sending, or storing NFT (when available) and digital rewards. However, NUD reserves the right to do so in the future, and in such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to the User incurring such fee. Notwithstanding, the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain may have Blockchain Transaction Fees required to transact digital reward transactions through the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain. NUD may attempt to calculate for the User any Blockchain Transactions Fees, though such calculation may be inaccurate or excessive. The User may select a greater or lesser fee, and the User is solely responsible for paying any Blockchain Transaction Fees required on the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain. NUD will neither advance nor fund any Blockchain Transaction Fee on any User’s behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.\r\n1.4.7 The User shall be responsible for all activities that occur through the NERDUNITEDDEV APP and accepts all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to the NerdUnitedDev app, to the maximum extent permitted by law. The User represents and warrants that the User is familiar with and accepts the risks associated with digital apps and private keys, including the risks described herein.\r\n1.4.8. From time to time, there may be programs in place to allow User to receive a reward, in the form of NerdUnitedDev Reward, NFT, or otherwise, based on actions taken by the User, whether it be by referral or other program in place at the time (“Additional Rewards”). User understands that NUD makes no representations or warrants regarding the Additional Rewards. Notwithstanding or limiting the foregoing, NUD further makes no representations or warrants surrounding the operation of any NUD SERVICES or that said NUD SERVICES/Additional Rewards will be error-free or uninterrupted. User accepts the sole responsibility for taking any and all actions to obtain any Additional Rewards, and holds NUD harmless for any opportunity cost or losses that occur as a result of the non-receipt of anticipated Additional Rewards, monetary or otherwise.\r\n\r\n2. PAYMENT TERMS.\r\nYou can use the NUD SERVICES for free or for a charge, either of which is a “NUD Transaction.” Each NUD Transaction is an electronic contract between you and NUD and/or you and the entity providing the NUD Service as contracted by NUD. NUD will charge your selected payment method for any NUD Transaction that requires payment. If your chosen payment method cannot be charged for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we may attempt to charge you again or request that you provide another payment method. Unless otherwise provided, all NUD Transactions are non-refundable and final.\r\n2.1. Annual License and Monthly Service Fees.\r\nThe User shall pay a one-time NerdUnitedDev Node license fee and the then-current monthly service fee(s) for NUD SERVICES. NUD or any of its affiliates or third parties may be the party that sells the software or hardware for any NerdUnitedDev Node.\r\n2.2. Software License.\r\nThe User may be required to enter into a software license agreement with NUD or any third party for the use of any required software for each NerdUnitedDev Node. The User shall pay all associated software license fees.\r\n2.3. Maintenance and Hosting Fees.\r\nNUD does not maintain or host any NerdUnitedDev Node, but may refer the User to one or more third-party hosting companies that may or may not be affiliated with NUD. If the User elects and is part of a separate hosting agreement, the User may be required to pay certain data center operations, maintenance and power fees (“Maintenance Fees”). These Maintenance Fees may be deducted from the User’s digital rewards or NerdUnitedDev Reward with the consent of NUD, at NUD’s discretion. Users are responsible for any reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by User resulting or arising out of the User’s election to use a third-party hosting company.\r\n2.4. Blockchain Transaction Fees.\r\nThe delivery and receipt of any of the User’s digital rewards through the NerdUnitedDev App may be subject to network or transaction fees charged by the blockchain associated with the User-selected algorithm (“Blockchain Transaction Fees”), which are non-refundable. Blockchain Transaction Fees are paid to emit, record, verify, and process a transaction on the blockchain. Any withdrawal or transfer of the User’s digital rewards may be subject to Blockchain Transaction Fees.\r\n2.5. Other Third-Party Fees.\r\nCertain digital apps, app addresses, tools, and third-party software and devices (“Third-Party Fees”) used by the User may also charge the User a fee, including a per transaction or transfer fee, which are non-refundable. The User is responsible for satisfying any such fee(s). The User should note that any such fees may significantly reduce the User’s rewards and therefore the User is responsible for managing the selection, use, rate and frequency of their receipt of rewards to any such Third-Party Fees.\r\n2.6. Taxes.\r\nThe User is responsible for any taxes, and the User will pay for NUD SERVICES without any reduction for taxes. If the User is required by law to withhold any taxes from its payments to NUD the User must provide NUD with an official tax receipt or other qualified documentation to support such withholding, including value added tax (“VAT”), if applicable. The User will be liable to pay (or reimburse NUD) for any taxes, interest, penalties or fines which may arise from any mis-declaration made by the User. The User shall pay NUD for all taxes and governmental fees NUD is required to collect or pay upon sale or delivery of NUD SERVICES.\r\nPOTENTIAL USERS OF NFTS, DIGITAL REWARDS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BITCOIN, ARE FOREWARNED OF POSSIBLE FINANCIAL LOSS AT THE TIME SUCH REWARDS ARE EXCHANGED FOR FIAT CURRENCY DUE TO AN UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE. MOREOVER, A FAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE AT THE TIME OF EXCHANGE MAY RESULT IN A TAX LIABILITY. USERS SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISOR REGARDING ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE, SALE, TRADE, OR OTHER USE OF DIGITAL REWARDS. USER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF ANY APPLICABLE TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE, SALE, TRADE, OR OTHER USE OF NFTS, DIGITAL REWARDS, OR VIRTUAL CURRENCIES.\r\n\r\n3. USER OBLIGATIONS\r\n3.1. Registration\r\n(A) To use the NUD SERVICES, you will need to register an account through our Site. During the registration process, we will ask you for certain information, including but not limited to, your name, address and other personal information to verify your identity.

You hereby accept and acknowledge that you: (a) are of legal age in your respective jurisdiction to agree to this Agreement; and (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from using the NUD SERVICES.\r\n(B) By using your account, you agree and represent that you will use the NUD SERVICES for yourself and you may not use your account to act as an intermediary or broker for any other third party, person or entity. Unless expressly authorized by NUD, you are only allowed to have one account and are not allowed to sell, borrow, share or otherwise make available your account or any detail necessary to access your account to people or entities other than yourself. You are solely responsible and liable for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all usernames, email addresses, passwords, two-factor authentication codes or any other codes or credentials that you use to access the NUD SERVICES. Your account must not contain misleading or fraudulent information. Creating false information for your account, falsifying your country of origin or providing fraudulent identification documents is strictly prohibited.\r\n(C) During the registration of your account, you agree to provide us with the information we request for the purposes of identity verification and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime and permit us to keep a record of such information. You will need to complete certain verification procedures before you are permitted to use the NUD SERVICES, which procedures may be modified as a result of information collected about you on an ongoing basis. The information we request may include certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, social security number, taxpayer identification number, and a government identification. In providing us with this or any other information that may be required, you confirm that all of the information is true, accurate and not misleading. You agree to promptly keep us updated if any of the information you provide changes. YOU AUTHORIZE US TO MAKE INQUIRIES, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD PARTIES, THAT WE CONSIDER NECESSARY TO VERIFY YOUR IDENTITY OR PROTECT YOU AND/OR US AGAINST FRAUD OR OTHER FINANCIAL CRIME, AND TO TAKE ACTION WE DEEM NECESSARY BASED ON THE RESULTS OF SUCH INQUIRIES. WHEN WE CARRY OUT THESE INQUIRIES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE DISCLOSED TO CREDIT REFERENCE AND FRAUD PREVENTION OR FINANCIAL CRIME AGENCIES AND THAT THESE AGENCIES MAY RESPOND TO OUR INQUIRIES IN FULL.\r\n(D) To use the NUD SERVICES you may need to fulfill certain legal obligations in your country and/or state of residence. By accepting these terms in this Agreement, you confirm that you have reviewed your local laws and regulations and that you are aware of, and fulfill, any and all such obligations. Due to legal or regulatory prohibitions, we do not offer the use of the NUD SERVICES in certain jurisdictions. By accepting the terms in this Agreement, you confirm that you are not a resident or governed by the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions.\r\n(E) We may not make all of the Services available in all markets and jurisdictions and may restrict or prohibit use of all or a portion of the Services from certain jurisdictions (“Restricted Jurisdictions”). At this time, Restricted Jurisdictions include jurisdictions subject to sanctions identified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Control. You must not attempt to use our Services if you are located in any of those Restricted Jurisdictions. You must not attempt to circumvent any restrictions imposed via the Services, such as by obscuring your IP address or submitting any inaccurate information regarding your location.\r\n3.2 Software and Equipment Allocation.\r\nThe User is responsible for the allocation of the User’s software and equipment and selected optimization strategies and decisions. The User acknowledges that NUD is not responsible for the selection or timing of blockchain protocols, nor is NUD responsible for the protocols selected for use in connection with NUD SERVICES. The User is solely responsible for these decisions. The User acknowledges that the node transactions on any blockchain may vary and will not be uniform across each NerdUnitedDev Node. The User acknowledges that the difficulty of mining may vary and will likely increase over time.\r\n3.3. Log-in Credentials.\r\nThe User represents and warrants that the User is responsible for the preservation of confidentiality of the User’s login credentials on the NerdUnitedDev App and any other login for the NUD SERVICES. Login credentials generated for the User by NUD are for the User’s internal use only and the User is strictly prohibited from selling, transferring, or sub-licensing them to any other entity or person.\r\n3.4. Blockchain Network Risk.\r\nThe User represents and warrants that the User accepts the risks of blockchain protocol and network, including instability, congestion, high transaction costs, network latency, information security, regulatory risk, and technological and operational error. The User understands these risks may result in delay or failure to process transactions, failure to generate hash rate, and potentially high Blockchain Transaction Fees or Third Party Fees. The User represents and agrees that NUD is not responsible for any diminished NUD SERVICES, related features, or capabilities resulting from blockchain network risk. In the event of a material increase or decrease to Blockchain Transaction Fees, Third Party Fees, or operational degradation, congestion, failure or other disruption of the blockchain network used by the User, NUD may, at its sole discretion and upon notice to the User, make any adjustments to the NUD SERVICES.\r\n3.5. Blockchain Modification Risk.\r\nThe User represents and warrants that the User is familiar with and accepts the risks associated with blockchain development and code changes. Blockchain technologies are still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Blockchain contributors may make changes to features and specifications of the algorithm selected by the User, and may fork the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain protocol. Such changes may include or result in the elimination or support for specific algorithms and applications.\r\n3.6 Consensus Protocol Replacement Risk\r\nIn addition to blockchain modification risk, blockchain contributors may also modify the cryptographic verification process such that the blockchains can no longer be verified through NerdUnitedDev Node Verification and instead adopt other methodologies like Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake. The User accepts and acknowledges such risk and shall allocate the User’s NerdUnitedDev Node to other available blockchains and mining processes that utilize NerdUnitedDev Node Verification or a similar process. The User further acknowledges that certain blockchain algorithms have no alternative blockchain applications that support NerdUnitedDev Node Verification and any such digital rewards earned from NerdUnitedDev Node Verification may be lost or destroyed.\r\n3.7. Trade Compliance.\r\nUser shall comply with all applicable import, re-import, sanctions, anti-boycott, export, and re-export control laws and regulations, including all such laws and regulations that apply to European Union and U.S. companies, such as the Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (collectively, “Trade Sanctions Laws”). The User represents and warrants that the User and the User’s financial institutions, or any party that owns or controls the User or the User’s financial institutions, are not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. Government (e.g., the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign as Evaders List of the U.S. Department of Treasury, and the Entity List of the U.S. Department of Commerce), the European Union or its Member States, or other applicable government authority. Further, User represents and warrants that it is currently in compliance with and shall at all times during the term of this agreement remain in compliance with the regulations of the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), including those named on OFAC’s Specially Designated and Blocked Persons List, and any statute, executive order (including the September 24, 2001, Executive Order Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons who Commit, Threaten to Commit or Support Terrorism), or other governmental action relating thereto. Specifically, User shall not engage in business, sell to, or form a business relationship on behalf of others or for itself with any individual or country in contravention or violation of the aforementioned rules, laws, and regulations. The User warrants that it is not named on any OFAC Blocked Persons List or resides in any country or territory sanctioned by OFAC. The User shall indemnify and hold harmless NUD against and from any claim, loss, damage or expense (including attorneys’ fees and costs for the underlying investigation) arising from any breach or misrepresentation of this section. If you do not reside in a jurisdiction located in the European Union or the United States, you hereby agree that any dispute or claim arising from this section of the Agreement shall be governed by the applicable law set forth in this section, without regard to any conflict of law provisions, and hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in section entitled “Governing Law” of this Agreement.\r\n3.8 Anti-Bribery\r\nUser acknowledges that its activities under this Agreement may be subject to United States and other anti-bribery and corruption legislation around the world (including without limitations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act).

THE USER UNDERSTANDS THAT ANY REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE USER AT ANY TIME THAT ANY OF THE NUD SERVICES ARE AN INVESTMENT IN NUD (OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IN GENERAL) TO OTHERS IN A DIRECT ATTEMPT TO MARKET NUD SERVICES IN COORDINATION WITH SUPPLYING USER’S REFERRAL LINK IS A DIRECT BREACH OF THE TERMS & CONDITIONS. A determination of same will be made at the sole discretion of NUD.\r\nUser further acknowledges that crypto assets are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) or any other public or private insurer, including against cyber theft or theft by other means. User understands that cryptocurrency activity is not a regulated activity in many states. User further acknowledges that the value of crypto assets can be extremely volatile and unpredictable, and subject to large fluctuations, which can result in significant losses in a short time, including possibly a loss of total value in the future.\r\n3.13 NERDUNITEDDEV NODE REPRESENTATIONS\r\nNUD and the User recognize that the SOLE AND ONLY purpose of the NerdUnitedDev Node is to support the NerdUnitedDev Node Network and facilitation validation of transactions on the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain. Nothing contained in this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement, or any representation made outside of this Agreement, conveys on the User any ownership interests in NUD or its subsidiaries, or interests otherwise in NUD (including, but not limited to voting rights in the NerdUnitedDev Node Network), nor any expectation of profits from the efforts of NUD or its principals or subsidiaries. The User understands that while it may from time to time receive rewards in line with the distribution protocol set forth by the charter authorizing the distributed governance framework (DGF) of the NerdUnitedDev Node Network (“Distribution Rewards”) (subject to change), said reward is solely earned because of and as a direct result of work accomplished and performed by the User (e.g., work done by the NerdUnitedDev Node ). The User recognizes that should the User never actually operate the NerdUnitedDev Node , the User will receive no rewards. NUD has no control of the protocol and method in which rewards are distributed in accordance with work performed by the NerdUnitedDev Node . It is anticipated that the NerdUnitedDev Node will be able to be sold or transferred in the future, potentially as NFTs, however, NUD cannot and does not warrant or represent that the resale value of the NerdUnitedDev Node s will be higher than the purchase price should this event occur, nor that it will be legally possible to do so. Further, NUD cannot and does not warrant or represent that there will ever be a resale value or capability of the NerdUnitedDev Node.\r\n\r\n4. TERMINATION\r\n4.1. General.\r\nNUD may suspend or terminate the User’s right to access or use NUD SERVICES immediately and without notice if: (i) NUD determines the User’s use of the NUD SERVICES poses a security risk to NUD SERVICES or any third party, could adversely impact NUD, NUD SERVICES, NerdUnitedDev Blockchain or any other NUD users, could subject NUD’S, its affiliates, or any third party to liability, could be fraudulent or violates any law applicable to User or NUD; (ii) the User is in breach of these Terms & Conditions; (iii) the User initiated a chargeback or dispute with respect to any payment or purchase of the NUD SERVICES; or (iv) the User has ceased to operate in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding.\r\n4.2.

DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE\r\n5.1. Decentralized Advisory Board. The NERDUNITEDDEV BLOCKCHAIN may have a decentralized advisory board that governs with decentralized voting such as on a blockchain.\r\n5.2. Consensus (Validator) Nodes. The NERDUNITEDDEV BLOCKCHAIN has consensus Validator nodes, which are the nodes that approve and validate transactions and contribute to the security and stability of the network. Any User that owns a NERDUNITEDDEV NODE involved in the consensus protocol associated with Validator nodes may be rewarded for work done to support the operation of the NERDUNITEDDEV BLOCKCHAIN and be able to charge Blockchain Transaction Fees.\r\n5.3. Community and Decentralized Innovation. The NERDUNITEDDEV BLOCKCHAIN invites any person or entity throughout the world to contribute to the NERDUNITEDDEV BLOCKCHAIN, including coders, application developers, marketers, advertisers, and service and maintenance providers. Accepted amendments, updates, and innovation from individuals or groups of the NERDUNITEDDEV BLOCKCHAIN community may be rewarded from the NERDUNITEDDEV BLOCKCHAIN rewards.\r\n5.4 Changes to NERDUNITEDDEV NODE Network. NUD and User recognize that from time to time amendments will be made to the NerdUnitedDev Node Network distributed governance framework (DGF). NUD and User both specifically agree that NUD may, in the future, present the NerdUnitedDev Node Network with proposed amendments (the “Proposed Amendments”) that the Node Network will then vote on whether to implement or not (the “Governance Vote”). The User understands that the Proposed Amendments will be made at the discretion of NUD, and NUD owes the User no duty or obligation to make proposals in User’s best interests. The User specifically understands that there may come a time when NUD proposes an amendment that is (i) not in or(ii) in direct opposition to the User’s best interests, financial or otherwise (including, but not limited to a change in the distribution protocol), and the User has no legal recourse against NUD should any Proposed Amendment be approved and implemented through the Governance Vote. The User’s only recourse is to vote against said Proposed Amendment. NUD and the User both agree that one such Proposed Amendment maybe to change the specifications, including, but not limited to the internet connection, Random Access Memory, Central Processing Unit requirements, extra space, and any other requirements needed to run the NerdUnitedDev Nodes (the “Specifications”). NUD and User further agree that while the Specifications may be minimal on the effective date of this Agreement, this is subject to change through the Proposed Amendment and the Governance Vote. NUD does not and cannot represent or covenant that any rewards earned (financial or otherwise) for running a NerdUnitedDev Node are not subject to change.\r\n\r\n6. PUBLICITY\r\nThe User is permitted to state publicly that it is a customer or user of NUD, consistent with any Trademark Guidelines which may be adopted by NUD from time to time. The User agrees to abide by the Privacy Policy of NUD.\r\n7. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\r\nEach User represents and warrants that: (i) it has full power and authority to enter into these Terms & Conditions; and (ii) it will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its provision or use of NUD SERVICES.\r\n\r\n8. DISCLOSURES & RISKS\r\n8.1 Notification. NUD notifies each User of certain disclosures and risks associated with blockchain NFT and digital rewards and their associated technology and protocols. NUD SERVICES are not an investment product, and no action, notice, communication by any means, or omission by NUD shall be understood or interpreted as such. NUD has no influence whatsoever on the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain, the transactions and consensus protocols, or the NFTs or digital rewards, including the NerdUnitedDev Reward. Ownership of a NerdUnitedDev App or Node or the use of NUD SERVICES does not represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security, debt or equivalent right, or any right to receive any future revenue or form of participation in or relating to any blockchain or digital reward, including the NerdUnitedDev Blockchain or NerdUnitedDev Reward.\r\n8.2 Digital Rewards. Digital rewards are not considered legal tender, are not issued or backed by any government, and have fewer regulatory protections than traditional currency. Moreover, digital rewards are not insured against theft or loss by any insurance corporation or any investor protection, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.\r\n8.3. Regulatory Risk. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual NFTs, digital rewards, and blockchain rewards. The regulatory status of digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact the NUD SERVICES in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that any of the above are regulated financial instruments that require registration. NUD may cease any distribution of any of the above, the development of the NerdUnitedDev App, Node, or other NUD platform or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so. The industry in which NUD operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental, quasi-governmental, regulatory or other similar types of (including banking) authorities will not examine the operations of NUD and/or pursue enforcement actions against NUD. Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting NUD in particular. All of this may subject NUD to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause NUD to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain blockchain-based products or services, all of which could harm NUD’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the NUD SERVICES.\r\n8.4 Technology Risk. Virtual NFT and digital reward transactions may be irreversible and losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some virtual transactions are deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which may not necessarily be the date or time the user initiated the transaction. The nature of such virtual transactions may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attacks.\r\n\r\n9. DISCLAIMER\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NUD, ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

NEITHER NUD, ITS AFFILIATES, NOR ITS SUPPLIERS, WARRANTS THAT THE OPERATION OF NUD SERVICES, NERDUNITEDDEV BLOCKCHAIN, OR ANY OTHER SUPPORTED BLOCKCHAIN WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED. NUD, ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS SUPPLIERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES OR OPPORTUNITY COSTS RESULTING FROM BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK AND PROTOCOL OR THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE ISSUES, WHICH MAY IN TURN RESULT IN THE INABILITY TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS ON ANY BLOCKCHAIN AT ALL OR WITHOUT INCURRING SUBSTANTIAL FEES.\r\n\r\n10.

THE NUD PARTIES SHALL NOT IN ANY CASE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST OPPORTUNITY COSTS, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF THE NUD PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\r\nThe User may be exposed to NUD’s (and other affiliated or third party blockchain protocols’) Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any information, in any form or medium, whether marked confidential or not, disclosed to the User under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, proprietary information, products, protocols, standards, manuals, services, business plans, customer lists, know-how, trade secrets, intellectual property rights, technical specifications, source code, object code, screen displays, designs, flowcharts, drawings, processes, algorithms, software programs, databases, marketing plans, articles, strategic direction, price lists, financial information or projections, notes, memoranda, extracts, summaries, reports, and/or analysis, including any and all derivative works of the aforementioned. “Confidential Information” shall not include information that is: (a) in the public domain, or subsequently becomes in the public domain, other than by breach of this or another agreement; (b) lawfully disclosed by a third party on a non-confidential basis to User, provided that the third party did not directly or indirectly receive the item from NUD; or (c) independently developed by the User without access to NUD’s Confidential Information and all such development efforts can be clearly documented by User.\r\nUser acknowledges that all Confidential Information is and shall continue to be the exclusive property of NUD.

User understands that all Confidential Information is important, unique, and materially affects NUD’s goodwill and success in conducting its business activities, and hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless NUD for damages that may arise from the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information by the User. This Agreement extends to Confidential Information that may have been previously disclosed to User prior to the execution of this Agreement by NUD, NUD’s affiliates, Connect and/or the broader ecosystem.\r\nThe User may be exposed to other third parties’ confidential or proprietary information. The User will safeguard and keep confidential the confidential or proprietary information of customers, vendors, contractors, and other parties with which NUD does business to the same extent as if it were NUDs Confidential Information and the prohibitions and restrictions herein apply equally to third parties confidential and proprietary information received by User pursuant to this Agreement as if it were NUD’s Confidential Information.\r\nUser shall immediately inform NUD, in writing, of any misappropriation, unauthorized use, or disclosure of Confidential Information and will cooperate in every reasonable way to prevent further disclosure and to obtain possession of the misappropriated Confidential Information.\r\nUpon written request from NUD, user shall return to NUD (or destroy upon the request of the NUD) all Confidential Information received by the User.\r\n\r\n13. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n13.1. Assignment.\r\nThe User will not assign or otherwise transfer the User’s rights and obligations under these Terms & Conditions, without the prior written consent of NUD, which may be unreasonably withheld. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this section will be void. At any time and without the need for User’s consent, NUD may assign any obligation, right and these Terms & Conditions. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms & Conditions will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. The User may not merge these Terms & Conditions with any other agreements with which NUD may be a party unless NUD provides its consent in writing or incorporates by reference these Terms & Conditions.\r\n13.2. Disputes.\r\nAny dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms & Conditions or relating in any way to the User’s use of NUD Sites or NUD SERVICES, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding any contractual or non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to these Terms & Conditions shall be commenced in accordance with the Arbitration section 13.2.1 below. Notwithstanding the foregoing NUD and the User agree that NUD may bring suit in court in the State of Wyoming (federal or state) to enjoin infringement or other misuse of NUD’s intellectual property rights. The prevailing party in any court action shall be entitled to costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.\r\n13.2.1 Arbitration\r\nYou and NUD agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services, shall be finally settled in binding arbitration, on an individual basis, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at https://www.adr.org/rules). Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis.\r\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\r\nThe Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies to the arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the State of Wyoming, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be entered as a judgement and enforced in any court of law. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.\r\nIf the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator’s rules or applicable law. Apart from the foregoing, each party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the party may incur.\r\nIf any part of this Agreement is held by any arbitrator or court of United States to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, the validity or enforceability of the other sections of these terms and conditions shall not be affected. Any headings contained in this Agreement are for informational purposes only and are not enforceable provisions of this Agreement.\r\n13.3. Entire Agreement.\r\nThese Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy sets out all the terms agreed between the parties and supersedes all other agreements between the parties relating to its subject matter. In entering into these Terms & Conditions, neither party has relied on, and neither party will have any right or remedy based on, any statement, representation or warranty (whether made negligently or innocently), except those expressly set out in these Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy. The terms may be updated on NUD sites.\r\n13.4. Force Majeure.\r\nNUD and its affiliates will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance of any obligation under these Terms & Conditions where the failures or delay results from any cause beyond reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, labor disputes or other industrial disturbances, electrical or power outages, utilities or other telecommunications failures, earthquake, storms or other elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism, or war. Force Majeure events include, but are not limited to, upgrades to the validation rules of a given blockchain (e.g., a “hard fork” or “soft fork”).\r\n13.5. Governing Law.\r\nAny claim or dispute between the User and NUD arising out of or relating to the User’s use of NUD sites, NUD SERVICES, or these Terms & Conditions, in whole or in part, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, USA without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. The 1980 United Nations Conventions on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not govern these Terms & Conditions.\r\n13.6. Language.\r\nAll communications and notices made or given pursuant to these Terms & Conditions must be in the English language. If we provide a translation of the English language version of these Terms & Conditions, the English language version will control if there is any conflict.\r\n13.7.

NUD may update the address for notices by posting on the NUD Site.\r\n13.8. Severability.\r\nIf any portion of these Terms & Conditions is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.\r\n13.9 No Third-Party Beneficiaries\r\nThis Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit, or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this agreement.\r\n13.10 Relationship\r\nNothing herein shall be construed to create a joint venture or partnership between the parties hereto or an employer/employee or agency relationship. Neither party hereto shall have any express or implied right or authority to assume or create any obligations on behalf of or in the name of the other party or to bind the other party to any contract, agreement, or undertaking with any third party.\r\n\r\n14. Return Policy\r\nAll sales are final and no refunds will be issued.\r\n\r\n15. Other Terms and Conditions\r\nAdditional terms and conditions may apply to purchases of goods or services and to specific portions or features of the NUD SERVICES, including contests, promotions or other similar features, all of which terms are made a part of this Agreement by this reference. You agree to abide by such other terms and conditions, including where applicable representing that you are of sufficient legal age to use or participate in such service or feature.
