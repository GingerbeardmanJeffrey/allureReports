HOLDING NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS CARRIES EXCHANGE RATE AND OTHER TYPES OF RISK. THE VALUE OF NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS MAY BE DERIVED FROM THE CONTINUED WILLINGNESS OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO EXCHANGE TRADITIONAL GOVERNMENT CURRENCY FOR DIGITAL REWARDS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE POTENTIAL FOR PERMANENT AND TOTAL LOSS OF VALUE OF A PARTICULAR DIGITAL REWARD SHOULD THE MARKET DISAPPEAR. THE VOLATILITY AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE PRICE AND VALUE OF NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS, RELATIVE TO GOVERNMENT CURRENCY, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. NERD UNITED DEV DOES NOT AND CANNOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THE VALUE OF ANY NFT, DIGITAL REWARD OR BLOCKCHAIN, INCLUDING THE NERD UNITED DEV BLOCKCHAIN AND NERD UNITED DEV REWARD, AND EXPLICITLY WARNS THE USER THAT THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY NFT, DIGITAL REWARD, OR BLOCKCHAIN REWARD WILL INCREASE IN VALUE, AND THAT THEY MAY HOLD NO VALUE, DECREASE IN VALUE, OR ENTIRELY LOSE VALUE.\r\nGeneral Terms and Affirmation: These Terms and Conditions constitute the User Agreement and Terms of Service (hereafter the “Terms & Conditions” or this “Agreement”) between Nerd United Dev (also referred to as “NERD UNITED DEV”) and any person, customer, or entity (referred as the “User”, “You,” “Your,”) utilizing the website, app.dev.nerdunited.com (hereafter the “Site”), NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain, and any blockchain-based products, features and services provided thereon as defined below (“NERD UNITED DEV Services”). These Terms & Conditions do not create any agency, partnership, or joint venture between NERD UNITED DEV and User. By signing up for an account through NERD UNITED DEV or any NERD UNITED DEV owned websites, APIs, or mobile applications, the User has read and consents to these Terms & Conditions. The User also agrees to NERD UNITED DEV’s Privacy Policy. These Terms & Conditions may be amended and updated from time to time at the sole discretion of NERD UNITED DEV. Revised versions will be considered effective as of the date and time posted on the NERD UNITED DEV Site. Your access to or use of the NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES or Site indicates your acceptance of these Terms & Conditions. You are agreeing to use the Site and the NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES at your own risk.\r\nTerms found in this Agreement that relate to the NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES or NERD UNITED DEV content, features, or functionality that are not available in your home jurisdiction are not applicable to you unless and until they become available to you. Certain NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES available to you in your home jurisdiction may not be available to you when traveling outside of your home jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nUSER AFFIRMS HE/SHE IS OVER THE AGE OF 18 OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE THE USER RESIDES IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, AS THE NERD UNITED DEV APP AND NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER AGE 18 OR THOSE THAT HAVE NOT REACHED THE AGE OF MAJORITY.\r\n1. NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES.\r\nNERD UNITED DEV Services include the facilitation of a distributed application operable with a decentralized blockchain network, using smart contracts (each a “Smart Contract”) to enable Users to own, buy, sell, transfer, and share unique digital rewards that can be visualized on the NERD UNITED DEV Site and/or through the NERD UNITED DEV APP. To use the NERD UNITED DEV Services, a User needs compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (depending on the NERD UNITED DEV Service). The NERD UNITED DEV Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.\r\n1.1 NERD UNITED DEV Node.\r\nThe NERD UNITED DEV Node is a computer software system functionally connected to the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain. The NERD UNITED DEV Node supports blockchain work by maintaining the cryptography and confirming transactions facilitating recordation and validation thereof on the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain.(“Nerd United Dev Node Verification”) “The Nerd United Dev Node supports the blockchain by maintaining the cryptography, confirming transactions, and performing other functions for the Nerd United Dev Blockchain”. It is foreseeable that at the option of the User, the Nerd United Dev Node may be recommissioned by the User to support other blockchains or other technologies. Used herein, “Nerd United Dev Node” may represent either the node itself or a license the User obtains to run the node. The Nerd United Dev Nodes when combined form the “Nerd United Dev Node Network.” Owners of Nerd United Dev Nodes can earn IZE Digital Rewards by operating their nodes in accordance with automated algorithmically driven Smart Contracts conforming with provisions of a distributed governance framework (“DGF”) set forth and initiated in a charter ratified by a community of owners of Nerd United Dev Nodes comprising the Nerd United Dev Node Network and corresponding to the Nerd United Dev Blockchain.\r\n1.2 NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain.\r\nThe NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain allows each user to log digital items, characters, non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) digital rewards, and other attributes on the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain public ledger that allows for decentralized, immutable record of ownership. When a User purchases, earns, or receives any NFT or digital reward through a Smart Contract process, the User owns completely and outright the digital reward. For the avoidance of doubt, the User acknowledges and agrees that while the User may own an NFT or digital reward, the underlying embedded intellectual property rights may be subject to certain licensing requirements, and the only way such rights can be conveyed to Users is if the associated conveyor holds a valid license to the intellectual property and conveys the same. If such license terminates, the conveyor, and by extension the User, may not have any rights to the underlying embedded intellectual property in the User’s NFTs or other digital assets, and the underlying embedded intellectual property may be changed or removed at the rights owner’s determination.\r\n1.3 NERD UNITED DEV Reward.\r\nEach User of any service on the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain and associated NERD UNITED DEV Node may be able to earn the NERD UNITED DEV Digital Reward, which may or may not be bridged to other blockchains (including but not limited to Ethereum) through a minting process solely at the option and action of the User. The NERD UNITED DEV Digital Reward is a digital reward and not a security token. NERD UNITED DEV Digital Rewards are not being offered to investors and there is no Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to promote NERD UNITED DEV Digital Rewards. Like BTC (which is the digital reward generated from the Bitcoin Blockchain), the NERD UNITED DEV Digital Reward is created through a unique blockchain protocol. Its utility may reside solely within the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain and may or may not have value. NERD UNITED DEV Digital Reward is not available for purchase from NERD UNITED DEV. Moreover, NERD UNITED DEV cannot, and does not, control whether any of the NERD UNITED DEV Digital Reward, any NFT, and any other digital reward has monetary value on any other blockchain. On the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain, the NERD UNITED DEV Site, the Nerd United Dev App, or any website or application associated with the NERD UNITED DEV Services, neither the NERD UNITED DEV Digital Reward, nor NFT, nor other digital reward may be exchanged for currency. NERD UNITED DEV Digital Reward is a digital reward earned in exchange for work and action on the NERD UNITED DEV Node network. NERD UNITED DEV Digital Reward is designed to have utility on the NERD UNITED DEV platform for the purchase of NERD UNITED DEV products and services. NERD UNITED DEV Digital Reward is not an investment product and may never have any value. NERD UNITED DEV node owners should not expect to recognize any value from NERD UNITED DEV Digital Reward other than its utility within the NERD UNITED DEV Platform ecosystem. NERD UNITED DEV does not anticipate NERD UNITED DEV Digital Reward’s value correlating with NERD UNITED DEV’s business activities.\r\n1.4 NERD UNITED DEV App\r\n1.4.1. NERD UNITED DEV will provide each User with a NERD UNITED DEV App to serve as the User’s wallet. NERD UNITED DEV will never take custody or control over any digital rewards stored in a User’s NERD UNITED DEV App. The NERD UNITED DEV App does not store, send or receive any NFT or digital reward, but such transactions occur directly on the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain or other supported blockchains. Instead of the NERD UNITED DEV App, the User may use any compatible digital app or wallet provided by a third-party company that safely connects to the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain. A User may be able to use the NERD UNITED DEV App or other compatible wallet to send and receive digital rewards with other users of the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain. NERD UNITED DEV does not offer any User the ability to exchange one form of currency for any other form of currency (fiat or digital). NERD UNITED DEV App is not a custodian, exchange or money transmitter.\r\n1.4.2. When a User creates a NERD UNITED DEV App, the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain software generates a cryptographic private key and public key pair that the User must use to send and receive any digital reward supported on the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain. The User is solely responsible for storing and keeping secret, outside of NERD UNITED DEV’s Services, a backup of any User’s NERD UNITED DEV App credentials, private key(s), passwords, and transaction information that the User maintains in the NERD UNITED DEV App or otherwise with the NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES. It is recommended that User backup its NERD UNITED DEV App. If the User does not backup the NERD UNITED DEV App, the User may not be able to access the NERD UNITED DEV App in the event that NERD UNITED DEV discontinues some or all of the NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES. Any digital reward a User has stored within its NERD UNITED DEV App may become inaccessible if the User does not know or keep secret its NERD UNITED DEV App keys and passwords. NERD UNITED DEV does not receive or store a User’s app passwords, PIN, keys, network addresses or transaction history. NERD UNITED DEV cannot assist any User with app password or key retrieval. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of a User’s credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase, app identifier, password, or keys) can dispose of the Digital reward in the User’s app.\r\n1.4.3. For a transaction to be validated on the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain, any NERD UNITED DEV transaction through the NERD UNITED DEV App must be confirmed and recorded in the distributed ledger associated with the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain. The NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network supported by the users of the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain, which is not owned, controlled or operated by NERD UNITED DEV.\r\n1.4.4. NERD UNITED DEV has no control over digital rewards generated through the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain, and cannot ensure that any transaction details a User submits via the NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES and NERD UNITED DEV App will be confirmed or processed on the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain. The User agrees and understands that the transaction details submitted by the User via the NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES and NERD UNITED DEV App may not be completed or may be delayed by the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain or any supporting blockchain used to process the transaction.NERD UNITED DEV does not guarantee that the NERD UNITED DEV App can transfer title or right in any NFT or digital reward, and NERD UNITED DEV makes no warranties of title of any kind. Once transaction details have been submitted to the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain, NERD UNITED DEV cannot assist the User to cancel or otherwise modify such transaction or details.\r\n1.4.5. In the event of a fork of the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain or any other supported blockchain, NERD UNITED DEV may not be able to support the User’s activity related to NERD UNITED DEV or any other supported NFT or digital reward. The User agrees and understands that in the event of a fork of the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain, any transaction associated with the NERD UNITED DEV App or NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES may not be completed, may be partially completed, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed.NERD UNITED DEV is not responsible for any loss incurred by any User caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a fork of the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain.\r\n1.4.6 NERD UNITED DEV does not currently charge a fee for the NERD UNITED DEV App, receiving, sending, or storing NFT (when available) and digital rewards. However, NERD UNITED DEV reserves the right to do so in the future, and in such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to the User incurring such fee. Notwithstanding, the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain may have Blockchain Transaction Fees required to transact digital reward transactions through the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain. NERD UNITED DEV may attempt to calculate for the User any Blockchain Transactions Fees, though such calculation may be inaccurate or excessive. The User may select a greater or lesser fee, and the User is solely responsible for paying any Blockchain Transaction Fees required on the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain. NERD UNITED DEV will neither advance nor fund any Blockchain Transaction Fee on any User’s behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.\r\n1.4.7 The User shall be responsible for all activities that occur through the NERD UNITED DEV APP and accepts all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to the NERD UNITED DEV app, to the maximum extent permitted by law. The User represents and warrants that the User is familiar with and accepts the risks associated with digital apps and private keys, including the risks described herein.\r\n1.4.8. From time to time, there may be programs in place to allow User to receive a reward, in the form of NERD UNITED DEV Reward, NFT, or otherwise, based on actions taken by the User, whether it be by referral or other program in place at the time (“Additional Rewards”). User understands that NERD UNITED DEV makes no representations or warrants regarding the Additional Rewards. Notwithstanding or limiting the foregoing, NERD UNITED DEV further makes no representations or warrants surrounding the operation of any NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES or that said NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES/Additional Rewards will be error-free or uninterrupted. User accepts the sole responsibility for taking any and all actions to obtain any Additional Rewards, and holds NERD UNITED DEV harmless for any opportunity cost or losses that occur as a result of the non-receipt of anticipated Additional Rewards, monetary or otherwise.\r\n\r\n2. PAYMENT TERMS.\r\nYou can use the NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES for free or for a charge, either of which is a “NERD UNITED DEV Transaction.” Each NERD UNITED DEV Transaction is an electronic contract between you and NERD UNITED DEV and/or you and the entity providing the NERD UNITED DEV Service as contracted by NERD UNITED DEV. NERD UNITED DEV will charge your selected payment method for any NERD UNITED DEV Transaction that requires payment. If your chosen payment method cannot be charged for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we may attempt to charge you again or request that you provide another payment method. Unless otherwise provided, all NERD UNITED DEV Transactions are non-refundable and final.\r\n2.1. Annual License and Monthly Service Fees.\r\nThe User shall pay a one-time NERD UNITED DEV Node license fee and the then-current monthly service fee(s) for NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES. NERD UNITED DEV or any of its affiliates or third parties may be the party that sells the software or hardware for any NERD UNITED DEV Node.\r\n2.2. Software License.\r\nThe User may be required to enter into a software license agreement with NERD UNITED DEV or any third party for the use of any required software for each NERD UNITED DEV Node. The User shall pay all associated software license fees.\r\n2.3. Maintenance and Hosting Fees.\r\nNERD UNITED DEV does not maintain or host any NERD UNITED DEV Node, but may refer the User to one or more third-party hosting companies that may or may not be affiliated with NERD UNITED DEV. If the User elects and is part of a separate hosting agreement, the User may be required to pay certain data center operations, maintenance and power fees (“Maintenance Fees”). These Maintenance Fees may be deducted from the User’s digital rewards or NERD UNITED DEV Reward with the consent of NERD UNITED DEV, at NERD UNITED DEV’s discretion. Users are responsible for any reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by User resulting or arising out of the User’s election to use a third-party hosting company.\r\n2.4. Blockchain Transaction Fees.\r\nThe delivery and receipt of any of the User’s digital rewards through the NERD UNITED DEV App may be subject to network or transaction fees charged by the blockchain associated with the User-selected algorithm (“Blockchain Transaction Fees”), which are non-refundable. Blockchain Transaction Fees are paid to emit, record, verify, and process a transaction on the blockchain. Any withdrawal or transfer of the User’s digital rewards may be subject to Blockchain Transaction Fees.\r\n2.5. Other Third-Party Fees.\r\nCertain digital apps, app addresses, tools, and third-party software and devices (“Third-Party Fees”) used by the User may also charge the User a fee, including a per transaction or transfer fee, which are non-refundable. The User is responsible for satisfying any such fee(s). The User should note that any such fees may significantly reduce the User’s rewards and therefore the User is responsible for managing the selection, use, rate and frequency of their receipt of rewards to any such Third-Party Fees.\r\n2.6. Taxes.\r\nThe User is responsible for any taxes, and the User will pay for NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES without any reduction for taxes. If the User is required by law to withhold any taxes from its payments to NERD UNITED DEV the User must provide NERD UNITED DEV with an official tax receipt or other qualified documentation to support such withholding, including value added tax (“VAT”), if applicable. The User will be liable to pay (or reimburse NERD UNITED DEV) for any taxes, interest, penalties or fines which may arise from any mis-declaration made by the User. The User shall pay NERD UNITED DEV for all taxes and governmental fees NERD UNITED DEV is required to collect or pay upon sale or delivery of NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES.\r\nPOTENTIAL USERS OF NFTS, DIGITAL REWARDS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BITCOIN, ARE FOREWARNED OF POSSIBLE FINANCIAL LOSS AT THE TIME SUCH REWARDS ARE EXCHANGED FOR FIAT CURRENCY DUE TO AN UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE. MOREOVER, A FAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE AT THE TIME OF EXCHANGE MAY RESULT IN A TAX LIABILITY. USERS SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISOR REGARDING ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE, SALE, TRADE, OR OTHER USE OF DIGITAL REWARDS. USER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF ANY APPLICABLE TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE, SALE, TRADE, OR OTHER USE OF NFTS, DIGITAL REWARDS, OR VIRTUAL CURRENCIES.\r\n\r\n3.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\r\nEach User represents and warrants that: (i) it has full power and authority to enter into these Terms & Conditions; and (ii) it will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its provision or use of NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES.\r\n\r\n8. DISCLOSURES & RISKS\r\n8.1 Notification. NERD UNITED DEV notifies each User of certain disclosures and risks associated with blockchain NFT and digital rewards and their associated technology and protocols. NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES are not an investment product, and no action, notice, communication by any means, or omission by NERD UNITED DEV shall be understood or interpreted as such. NERD UNITED DEV has no influence whatsoever on the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain, the transactions and consensus protocols, or the NFTs or digital rewards, including the NERD UNITED DEV Reward. Ownership of a NERD UNITED DEV App or Node or the use of NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES does not represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security, debt or equivalent right, or any right to receive any future revenue or form of participation in or relating to any blockchain or digital reward, including the NERD UNITED DEV Blockchain or NERD UNITED DEV Reward.\r\n8.2 Digital Rewards. Digital rewards are not considered legal tender, are not issued or backed by any government, and have fewer regulatory protections than traditional currency. Moreover, digital rewards are not insured against theft or loss by any insurance corporation or any investor protection, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.\r\n8.3. Regulatory Risk. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual NFTs, digital rewards, and blockchain rewards. The regulatory status of digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact the NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that any of the above are regulated financial instruments that require registration. NERD UNITED DEV may cease any distribution of any of the above, the development of the NERD UNITED DEV App, Node, or other NERD UNITED DEV platform or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so. The industry in which NERD UNITED DEV operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental, quasi-governmental, regulatory or other similar types of (including banking) authorities will not examine the operations of NERD UNITED DEV and/or pursue enforcement actions against NERD UNITED DEV. Such governmental activities may or may not be the result of targeting NERD UNITED DEV in particular. All of this may subject NERD UNITED DEV to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause NERD UNITED DEV to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain blockchain-based products or services, all of which could harm NERD UNITED DEV’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES.\r\n8.4 Technology Risk. Virtual NFT and digital reward transactions may be irreversible and losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some virtual transactions are deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which may not necessarily be the date or time the user initiated the transaction. The nature of such virtual transactions may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attacks.\r\n\r\n9. DISCLAIMER\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NERD UNITED DEV, ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

This Agreement extends to Confidential Information that may have been previously disclosed to User prior to the execution of this Agreement by NERD UNITED DEV, NERD UNITED DEV’s affiliates, Connect and/or the broader ecosystem.\r\nThe User may be exposed to other third parties’ confidential or proprietary information. The User will safeguard and keep confidential the confidential or proprietary information of customers, vendors, contractors, and other parties with which NERD UNITED DEV does business to the same extent as if it were NERD UNITED DEVs Confidential Information and the prohibitions and restrictions herein apply equally to third parties confidential and proprietary information received by User pursuant to this Agreement as if it were NERD UNITED DEV’s Confidential Information.\r\nUser shall immediately inform NERD UNITED DEV, in writing, of any misappropriation, unauthorized use, or disclosure of Confidential Information and will cooperate in every reasonable way to prevent further disclosure and to obtain possession of the misappropriated Confidential Information.\r\nUpon written request from NERD UNITED DEV, user shall return to NERD UNITED DEV (or destroy upon the request of the NERD UNITED DEV) all Confidential Information received by the User.\r\n\r\n13. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n13.1. Assignment.\r\nThe User will not assign or otherwise transfer the User’s rights and obligations under these Terms & Conditions, without the prior written consent of NERD UNITED DEV, which may be unreasonably withheld. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this section will be void. At any time and without the need for User’s consent, NERD UNITED DEV may assign any obligation, right and these Terms & Conditions. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms & Conditions will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. The User may not merge these Terms & Conditions with any other agreements with which NERD UNITED DEV may be a party unless NERD UNITED DEV provides its consent in writing or incorporates by reference these Terms & Conditions.\r\n13.2. Disputes.\r\nAny dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms & Conditions or relating in any way to the User’s use of NERD UNITED DEV Sites or NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding any contractual or non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to these Terms & Conditions shall be commenced in accordance with the Arbitration section 13.2.1 below. Notwithstanding the foregoing NERD UNITED DEV and the User agree that NERD UNITED DEV may bring suit in court in the State of Wyoming (federal or state) to enjoin infringement or other misuse of NERD UNITED DEV’s intellectual property rights. The prevailing party in any court action shall be entitled to costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees.\r\n13.2.1 Arbitration\r\nYou and NERD UNITED DEV agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services, shall be finally settled in binding arbitration, on an individual basis, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at https://www.adr.org/rules). Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis.\r\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\r\nThe Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies to the arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the State of Wyoming, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be entered as a judgement and enforced in any court of law. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.\r\nIf the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator’s rules or applicable law. Apart from the foregoing, each party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the party may incur.\r\nIf any part of this Agreement is held by any arbitrator or court of United States to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, the validity or enforceability of the other sections of these terms and conditions shall not be affected. Any headings contained in this Agreement are for informational purposes only and are not enforceable provisions of this Agreement.\r\n13.3. Entire Agreement.\r\nThese Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy sets out all the terms agreed between the parties and supersedes all other agreements between the parties relating to its subject matter. In entering into these Terms & Conditions, neither party has relied on, and neither party will have any right or remedy based on, any statement, representation or warranty (whether made negligently or innocently), except those expressly set out in these Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy. The terms may be updated on NERD UNITED DEV sites.\r\n13.4. Force Majeure.\r\nNERD UNITED DEV and its affiliates will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance of any obligation under these Terms & Conditions where the failures or delay results from any cause beyond reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, labor disputes or other industrial disturbances, electrical or power outages, utilities or other telecommunications failures, earthquake, storms or other elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism, or war. Force Majeure events include, but are not limited to, upgrades to the validation rules of a given blockchain (e.g., a “hard fork” or “soft fork”).\r\n13.5. Governing Law.\r\nAny claim or dispute between the User and NERD UNITED DEV arising out of or relating to the User’s use of NERD UNITED DEV sites, NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES, or these Terms & Conditions, in whole or in part, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, USA without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. The 1980 United Nations Conventions on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not govern these Terms & Conditions.\r\n13.6. Language.\r\nAll communications and notices made or given pursuant to these Terms & Conditions must be in the English language. If we provide a translation of the English language version of these Terms & Conditions, the English language version will control if there is any conflict.\r\n13.7.

Severability.\r\nIf any portion of these Terms & Conditions is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.\r\n13.9 No Third-Party Beneficiaries\r\nThis Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit, or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this agreement.\r\n13.10 Relationship\r\nNothing herein shall be construed to create a joint venture or partnership between the parties hereto or an employer/employee or agency relationship. Neither party hereto shall have any express or implied right or authority to assume or create any obligations on behalf of or in the name of the other party or to bind the other party to any contract, agreement, or undertaking with any third party.\r\n\r\n14. Return Policy\r\nAll sales are final and no refunds will be issued.\r\n\r\n15. Other Terms and Conditions\r\nAdditional terms and conditions may apply to purchases of goods or services and to specific portions or features of the NERD UNITED DEV SERVICES, including contests, promotions or other similar features, all of which terms are made a part of this Agreement by this reference. You agree to abide by such other terms and conditions, including where applicable representing that you are of sufficient legal age to use or participate in such service or feature.
