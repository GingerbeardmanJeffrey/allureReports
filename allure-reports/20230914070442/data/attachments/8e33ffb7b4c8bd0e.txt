HOLDING NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS CARRIES EXCHANGE RATE AND OTHER TYPES OF RISK. THE VALUE OF NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS MAY BE DERIVED FROM THE CONTINUED WILLINGNESS OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO EXCHANGE TRADITIONAL GOVERNMENT CURRENCY FOR DIGITAL REWARDS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE POTENTIAL FOR PERMANENT AND TOTAL LOSS OF VALUE OF A PARTICULAR DIGITAL REWARD SHOULD THE MARKET DISAPPEAR. THE VOLATILITY AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE PRICE AND VALUE OF NFTS AND DIGITAL REWARDS, RELATIVE TO GOVERNMENT CURRENCY, MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSS OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. [BRAND] DOES NOT AND CANNOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THE VALUE OF ANY NFT, DIGITAL REWARD OR BLOCKCHAIN, INCLUDING THE [BRAND] BLOCKCHAIN AND [BRAND] REWARD, AND EXPLICITLY WARNS THE USER THAT THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY NFT, DIGITAL REWARD, OR BLOCKCHAIN REWARD WILL INCREASE IN VALUE, AND THAT THEY MAY HOLD NO VALUE, DECREASE IN VALUE, OR ENTIRELY LOSE VALUE.\nThese Terms and Conditions constitute the User Agreement and Terms of Service (hereafter the “Terms & Conditions”) between share.[BRAND] (referred to as “[BRAND] ” or the “Site” and defined below) and any person, customer, or entity (referred to as the “User”) utilizing the Site, [BRAND] Blockchain, and any products, features and services provided thereon (“[BRAND] Services”). These Terms & Conditions do not create any agency, partnership, or joint venture between [BRAND] and User. By registering for an account through [BRAND] or any associated websites, APIs, or mobile applications, the User represents that User has read and consents to the Terms & Conditions; by so registering the User also agrees to [BRAND]’s Privacy Policy. These Terms & Conditions may be amended and updated from time to time at the sole discretion of [BRAND]. Revised versions will be considered effective as of the date and time posted on the Site. Your access to or use of the [BRAND]’s Services or Site indicates your acceptance of these Terms & Conditions. You are agreeing to use the Site and the [BRAND] Services at your own risk. \nTerms found in this Agreement that relate to the [BRAND] Services or [BRAND] content, features, or functionality that are not available in your home jurisdiction are not applicable to you unless and until they become available to you. Certain [BRAND] Services available to you in your home jurisdiction may not be available to you when traveling outside of your home jurisdiction.\n\n\nUSER AFFIRMS HE/SHE IS OVER THE AGE OF 18 OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE THE USER RESIDES IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, AS THE [BRAND] APP AND [BRAND] SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER AGE 18 OR THOSE THAT HAVE NOT REACHED THE AGE OF MAJORITY.\n1. [BRAND] SERVICES. \n[BRAND] is a decentralized distributed application on a blockchain network, using smart contracts (each a “Smart Contract”) to enable Users to own, buy, sell, transfer, and share unique digital rewards that can be visualized on the Site through the [BRAND] App, defined below in Section 1.4.  \n1.1 [BRAND] Node. “[BRAND] Node” is a computer software and/or hardware system connected to the [BRAND] blockchain. The [BRAND] Node supports blockchain work by maintaining the cryptography and confirming transactions on the [BRAND] Blockchain. It is foreseeable that at the option of a User who owns a [BRAND] Node, the [BRAND] Node may be recommissioned by the User to support other blockchains or other technologies.  As used herein, “[BRAND] Node” may represent either the node itself or a license the User obtains to run the node.  The [BRAND] Nodes, when operating in conjunction with one another pursuant to the [BRAND] Blockchain protocol, form the “[BRAND] Node Network.”\n1.2 [BRAND] Blockchain. The “[BRAND] Blockchain” allows each User to store digital rewards and other attributes on the [BRAND] Blockchain public ledger that allows for decentralized, immutable record of ownership. The [BRAND] Blockchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network supported by the users of the [BRAND] Blockchain, which is not owned, controlled or operated by [BRAND]. When the User purchases, earns, or receives any digital reward through the Smart Contract process, the User owns completely and outright the digital reward.\n1.3 [BRAND] Reward. Each User of any service on the [BRAND] Blockchain and associated [BRAND] Node may be able to earn the “[BRAND] Reward.” The [BRAND] Reward is a digital reward. [BRAND] Reward is not a security. [BRAND] Reward is not being offered for sale; rather, it is only distributed through a decentralized protocol to Users and [BRAND] Node owners in exchange for their [BRAND]-related activity. . Like BTC (which is the digital reward generated from the Bitcoin Blockchain), [BRAND] Reward is created through a unique blockchain protocol. [BRAND] Reward’s value is not directly influenced by the efforts of any party other than holders of [BRAND] Rewards. Although [BRAND] Reward has the potential to effectively subsidize the cost of power, its utility may reside solely within the [BRAND] Blockchain and may or may not have value. \n1.4 [BRAND] App\n1.4.1 [BRAND] will provide each User with a [BRAND] App, which enables the User to manage its digital assets, including [BRAND] Rewards. [BRAND] will never take custody or control over any Platform Rewards stored in a User’s [BRAND] App. The [BRAND] App does not store, send or receive any NFT or digital reward, but such transactions occur directly on the [BRAND] Blockchain or other supported blockchains. Instead of the [BRAND] App, the User may use any compatible digital app or wallet provided by a third-party company that safely connects to the [BRAND] Blockchain. [BRAND] is not responsible for any damage incurred through the use of such a compatible digital app or wallet provided by a third-party company. A User may be able to use the [BRAND] App or other compatible wallet to send and receive Platform Rewards with other users of the [BRAND] Blockchain. [BRAND] does not offer any User the ability to exchange one form of currency for any other form of currency (fiat or digital). [BRAND] App is not a custodian, exchange, or money transmitter.\n1.4.2 When a User creates a [BRAND] App, the [BRAND] Blockchain software generates a cryptographic private key and public key pair that the User must use to send and receive any digital reward supported on the [BRAND] Blockchain. The User is solely responsible for storing and keeping secret, and outside of [BRAND]’s Services, a backup of the User’s [BRAND] App credentials, private key(s), passwords, and transaction information that the User maintains in the [BRAND] App or otherwise with the [BRAND] Services. If the User does not backup the [BRAND] App, the User may not be able to access the [BRAND] App in the event that [BRAND] discontinues some or all of the [BRAND] Services. Any digital reward a User has stored within its [BRAND] App may become inaccessible if the User does not know or keep secret its [BRAND] App keys and passwords. [BRAND] does not receive or store the User’s [BRAND] App passwords, PIN, keys, network addresses or transaction history. [BRAND] cannot assist the User with [BRAND] App password or key retrieval. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of the User’s credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase, app identifier, password, or keys) can dispose of the digital reward in the User’s app.\n1.4.3 In order for a transaction to be validated on the [BRAND] Blockchain, any transaction through the [BRAND] App must be confirmed and recorded in the distributed ledger associated with the [BRAND] Blockchain. \n1.4.4 [BRAND] has no control over Platform Rewards generated through the [BRAND] Blockchain and cannot ensure that any transaction details the User submits via the [BRAND] Services and/or [BRAND] App will be confirmed or processed on the [BRAND] Blockchain. The User agrees and understands that the transaction details submitted by the User via the [BRAND] Services and/or [BRAND] App may not be completed or may be delayed by the [BRAND] Blockchain or any supporting blockchain used to process the transaction. [BRAND] does not guarantee that the [BRAND] App can transfer title or right in any NFT or digital reward, and [BRAND] makes no warranties of title of any kind. Once transaction details have been submitted to the [BRAND] Blockchain, [BRAND] cannot assist the User to cancel or otherwise modify such transaction or details.\n1.4.5 In the event of a fork of the [BRAND] Blockchain or any other supported blockchain, [BRAND] may not be able to support the User’s activity related to [BRAND] or any other supported NFT or reward. The User agrees and understands that in the event of a fork of the [BRAND] Blockchain, any transaction associated with the [BRAND] App or [BRAND] Services may not be completed, may be partially completed, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. [BRAND] is not responsible for any loss incurred by any User caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a fork of the [BRAND] Blockchain.\n1.4.6 [BRAND] does not currently charge a fee for downloading, accessing, or using the [BRAND] App. However, [BRAND] reserves the right to do so in the future, and in such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to the User incurring such fees. Notwithstanding, the [BRAND] Blockchain may have Blockchain Transaction Fees required to transact digital reward transactions through the [BRAND] Blockchain. [BRAND] may attempt to calculate any Blockchain Transactions Fees for the User, though such calculation may be inaccurate. The User is solely responsible for paying any Blockchain Transaction Fees required on the [BRAND] Blockchain. [BRAND] will neither advance nor fund any Blockchain Transaction Fee on any User’s behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.\n1.4.7 The User shall be responsible for all activities that the User engages in through the [BRAND] App. The User accepts all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to the [BRAND] App, to the maximum extent permitted by law. The User represents and warrants that the User is familiar with and accepts the risks associated with digital apps and private keys, including the risks described herein.\n1.4.8 From time to time, there may be programs in place to allow User to receive a reward, in the form of [BRAND] Reward, NFT, or otherwise, based on actions taken by the User (“Additional Rewards”; [BRAND] Rewards and Additional Rewards are referred to herein as Platform Rewards).  User understands that [BRAND] makes no representations or warranties regarding the Additional Rewards.  Notwithstanding or limiting the foregoing, [BRAND] further makes no representations or warranties surrounding the operation of any [BRAND] Services or that said [BRAND] Services and/or Additional Rewards will be error-free or uninterrupted.  User accepts the sole responsibility for taking any and all actions to obtain any Additional Rewards and holds [BRAND] harmless for any opportunity cost or losses that occur as a result of the non-receipt of anticipated Additional Rewards, monetary or otherwise.\n\n2. PAYMENT TERMS.\n2.1 Annual License and Monthly Service Fees.\nThe User shall pay a one-time [BRAND] Node license fee and may be charged monthly service fee(s) for [BRAND] Services. [BRAND] may, at its discretion, designate or license any of its affiliates or any third party to sell software or hardware necessary to support any [BRAND] Node. [BRAND] shall have no liability, and makes no representations or warranties, with regard to any such transaction between the User and any [BRAND] affiliate or third party.\n2.2 Software License.\nThe User may be required to enter into a software license agreement with [BRAND] or any third party for the use of any required software for each [BRAND] Node. The User shall pay all associated software license fees.\n2.3 Equipment Purchase.\nThe User may enter into an equipment purchase agreement with a third party as it relates to the purchase of any hardware for a [BRAND] Node.

If the User elects to enter into such a hosting agreement with a third party, the User may be required to pay certain data center operations, maintenance and power fees (“Maintenance Fees”). These Maintenance Fees may be deducted from the User’s Platform Rewards or [BRAND] Reward with the consent of [BRAND], at [BRAND]’s discretion.\n2.5 Blockchain Transaction Fees.\nThe delivery and receipt of any of the User’s Platform Rewards through the [BRAND] App may be subject to network or transaction fees charged by the blockchain associated with the User-selected algorithm (“Blockchain Transaction Fees”), which are non-refundable. Blockchain Transaction Fees are paid to emit, record, verify, and process a transaction on the [BRAND] Blockchain. Any withdrawal or transfer of the User’s Platform Rewards may be subject to Blockchain Transaction Fees.\n2.6 Other Third-Party Fees.\nCertain digital apps, app addresses, tools, and third-party software and devices (“Third-Party Fees”) used by the User may also charge the User a fee, including a per transaction or transfer fee, which are non-refundable. The User is responsible for satisfying any such fees. The User should note that any such fees may significantly reduce the User’s Platform Rewards and therefore the User is responsible for managing the selection, use, rate and frequency of their receipt of Platform Rewards to any such Third-Party Fees.\n2.7 Taxes.\nThe User is responsible for any taxes related to the use of the [BRAND] App and/or [BRAND] Services, and the User will pay for [BRAND] Services without any reduction for taxes. If the User is required by law to withhold any taxes from its payments to [BRAND], the User must provide [BRAND] with an official tax receipt or other qualified documentation to support such withholding, including value added tax (“VAT”), if applicable. The User will be liable to pay (or reimburse [BRAND]) for any taxes, interest, penalties, or fines which may arise from any mis-declaration made by the User. The User shall pay [BRAND] for all taxes and governmental fees [BRAND] is required to collect or pay upon sale or delivery of [BRAND] Services.\n2.8 Disclaimer of Potential Losses and Taxes\nPOTENTIAL USERS OF NFTS, DIGITAL ASSETS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BITCOIN, ARE FOREWARNED OF POSSIBLE FINANCIAL LOSS AT THE TIME SUCH REWARDS ARE EXCHANGED FOR FIAT CURRENCY DUE TO AN UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE. MOREOVER, A FAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE AT THE TIME OF EXCHANGE MAY RESULT IN A TAX LIABILITY. USERS SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISOR REGARDING ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE, SALE, TRADE, OR OTHER USE OF DIGITAL ASSETS. USER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF ANY APPLICABLE TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE, SALE, TRADE, OR OTHER USE OF NFTS, OR DIGITAL ASSETS.\n3. USER OBLIGATIONS\n3.1 Software and Equipment Allocation.\nThe User is responsible for the allocation of the User’s software, equipment, and any and all selected optimization strategies and decisions related thereto. The User acknowledges that [BRAND] is not responsible for the selection or timing of blockchain protocols, nor is [BRAND] responsible for the protocols selected for use in connection with [BRAND] Services. The User is solely responsible for these decisions. The User acknowledges that node transactions on any blockchain may vary and will not be uniform across each [BRAND] Node. The User acknowledges that the difficulty of mining may vary and will likely increase over time. \n3.2 Log-in Credentials.\nThe User represents and warrants that the User is responsible for the preservation of confidentiality of the User’s login credentials on the [BRAND] App and any other login for the [BRAND] Services. Login credentials generated for the User by [BRAND] are for the User’s internal use only and the User is strictly prohibited from selling, transferring, or sub-licensing them to any other entity or person.\n3.3 Blockchain Network Risk.\nThe User represents and warrants that the User knowingly accepts the risks associated with blockchain protocol and network use, including instability, congestion, high transaction costs, network latency, information security, regulatory risk, and technological and operational error. The User understands these risks may result in delay or failure to process transactions, failure to generate hash rate, and potentially high Blockchain Transaction Fees or Third-Party Fees. The User represents and agrees that [BRAND] is not responsible for any diminished [BRAND] Services, related features, or capabilities resulting from risks associated with blockchain protocol and network use. In the event of a material increase or decrease to Blockchain Transaction Fees, Third-Party Fees, or operational degradation, congestion, failure or other disruption of the blockchain network used by the User, [BRAND] may, at its sole discretion and upon notice to the User, make any adjustments to the [BRAND] Services.\n3.4 Blockchain Modification Risk.\nThe User represents and warrants that the User is familiar with and accepts the risks associated with blockchain development and modification. The User understands that Blockchain technologies are still under development and may undergo significant changes over time, and that Blockchain contributors may make changes to features and specifications of the algorithm selected by the User and may fork the [BRAND] Blockchain protocol. Such changes may include or result in the elimination or support for specific algorithms and applications.\n3.5 Proof-Of-Work Replacement Risk\nIn addition to blockchain modification risk, blockchain contributors may also modify the cryptographic verification process such that the blockchains can no longer be verified through Proof-of-Work and instead adopt Proof-of-Stake or other methodologies. The User accepts and acknowledges such risk and shall allocate the User’s hash rate to other available blockchains and mining processes that use Proof-of-Work methodologies. The User further acknowledges that certain blockchain algorithms have no alternative blockchain applications that support Proof-of-Work mining and any such [BRAND] transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake may result in no applicable use of the User’s hash rate.\n3.6 Trade Compliance.\nUser shall comply with all applicable import, re-import, sanctions, anti-boycott, export, and re-export control laws and regulations, including all such laws and regulations that apply to European Union and U.S. companies, such as the Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (collectively, “Trade Sanctions Laws”). The User represents and warrants that the User and the User’s financial institutions, or any party that owns or controls the User or the User’s financial institutions, are not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. Government (e.g., the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign as Evaders List of the U.S. Department of Treasury, and the Entity List of the U.S. Department of Commerce), the European Union or its Member States, or other applicable government authority.  Further, User represents and warrants that it is currently in compliance with and shall at all times during the term of this agreement remain in compliance with the regulations of the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), including those named on FFAC’s Specially Designated and Blocked Persons List, and any statute, executive order (including the September 24, 2001, Executive Order Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons who Commit, Threaten to Commit or Support Terrorism), or other governmental action relating thereto.

The User shall indemnify and hold harmless [BRAND] against and from any claim, loss, damage, or expense (including attorneys’ fees and costs for the underlying investigation) arising from any breach or misrepresentation of this section. User is solely responsible for all financial charges and legal liability that he or she may incur. \n3.11 Representations Made By User.\nUser acknowledges and agrees that the [BRAND] Services, including but not limited to the [BRAND] Node, ARE NOT being sold as an investment by or of [BRAND].  THE USER UNDERSTANDS THAT ANY REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE USER AT ANY TIME THAT ANY OF THE [BRAND] SERVICES ARE AN INVESTMENT IN [BRAND] (OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IN GENERAL) TO OTHERS IN AN ATTEMPT TO MARKET [BRAND] SERVICES IN COORDINATION WITH SUPPLYING USER’S REFERRAL LINK IS A BREACH OF THE TERMS & CONDITIONS. A determination of same will be made at the sole discretion of [BRAND].\n3.12 [BRAND] NODE REPRESENTATIONS\n[BRAND] and the User recognize that the SOLE AND ONLY purpose of the [BRAND] Node is to support the [BRAND] Node Ecosystem.  Nothing contained in these Terms and Conditions, any exhibit to these Terms and Conditions, or any representation made outside of these Terms and Conditions, conveys on the User any ownership interests in [BRAND] or its subsidiaries, or interests otherwise in [BRAND] (including, but not limited to voting rights), nor any expectation of profits from the efforts of [BRAND] or its principals or subsidiaries.  The User understands that while it may from time to time receive rewards in line with the distribution schedule of the [BRAND] Node Ecosystem (“Distribution Rewards') (subject to change), said reward is solely earned because of and as a direct result of work accomplished and performed by the User (e.g. work done by the [BRAND] Node).  The User recognizes that should the User never actually run the [BRAND] Node, it will receive no rewards.  [BRAND] has no control of the method in which rewards are distributed to the [BRAND] Node.  It is anticipated that the [BRAND] Node will be able to be sold or transferred in the future as NFTs, however, [BRAND] cannot and does not warrant or represent that the resale value of the Nodes will be higher than the purchase price should this event occur, nor that it will be legally possible to do so.  Further, [BRAND] cannot and does not warrant or represent that there will ever be a resale value or capability of the [BRAND] Node.  \n4. TERMINATION\n4.1 General.\n[BRAND] may suspend or terminate the User’s right to access or use [BRAND] Services immediately and without notice if: (i) [BRAND] determines the User’s use of the [BRAND] Services poses a security risk to [BRAND] or any third party, could adversely impact [BRAND], [BRAND] Services, the [BRAND] App, [BRAND] Blockchain or any other [BRAND] users, or could subject [BRAND], its affiliates, or any third party to liability; (ii) [BRAND] determines at any time that the User may have engaged in fraudulent activity at any point in relation to its use of the [BRAND] Services; (iii) the User is in breach of these Terms & Conditions; (iv) the User initiated a chargeback or dispute with respect to any payment or purchase of the [BRAND] Services; or (v) the User has ceased to operate in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar proceeding.\n4.2 Effect of Suspension.\nIf [BRAND] suspends the User’s right to access or use any portion or all of the [BRAND] Services, the User shall remain responsible for all fees and charges the User incurs during the period of suspension, including any Maintenance Fees and Blockchain Transaction Fees; and the User may be in violation of the User’s hosting agreement or the blockchain protocols, which may prevent or limit the User’s entitlement or access to any results or rewards that may have occurred during the User’s suspension of the [BRAND] Services. User agrees to pay any fee charged by [BRAND] to reconnect the [BRAND] Services.\n4.3 Effect of Termination.\nIf [BRAND] terminates the User’s right to access or use any portion of the [BRAND] Services, then all of the User’s rights under these Terms & Conditions immediately terminate and the User shall remain responsible for all fees owed to [BRAND] incurred through the termination date.\n5. DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE\n5.1 Decentralized Advisory Board. The [BRAND] Blockchain may have a decentralized advisory board.\n5.2 Consensus Nodes. The [BRAND] Blockchain has consensus nodes, which are the [BRAND] Nodes that approve and validate transactions and contribute to the security and stability of the network. Any User that owns a [BRAND] Node involved in the consensus protocol may be rewarded from the [BRAND] Blockchain and be able to charge Blockchain Transaction Fees.\n5.3 Community and Decentralized Innovation. The [BRAND] Blockchain invites any person or entity throughout the world to contribute to the [BRAND] Blockchain, including coders, application developers, marketers, advertisers, and service and maintenance providers. Accepted amendments, updates, and innovation from individuals or groups of the [BRAND] Blockchain community may be rewarded from the [BRAND] Blockchain rewards.\n6. PUBLICITY\nThe User is permitted to state publicly that it is a customer or user of [BRAND], consistent with any Trademark Guidelines which may be adopted by [BRAND] from time to time. The User agrees to abide by the Privacy Policy and Code of Conduct of [BRAND]. \n7. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\nEach User represents and warrants that: (i) it has full power and authority to enter into these Terms & Conditions; and (ii) it will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its provision or use of [BRAND] Services. \n8. DISCLOSURES & RISKS\n8.1 Notification. \n[BRAND] notifies each User of certain disclosures and risks associated with blockchain, NFT, and digital rewards and their associated technology and protocols. [BRAND] Services are not an investment product, and no action, notice, communication by any means, or omission by [BRAND] shall be understood or interpreted as such. [BRAND] has no influence whatsoever on the [BRAND] Blockchain, the transactions and consensus protocols, or the NFTs or digital rewards, including the [BRAND] Reward. Ownership of a [BRAND] App or [BRAND] Node or the use of [BRAND] Services does not represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security, debt or equivalent right, or any right to receive any future revenue or form of participation in or relating to any blockchain or digital reward, including the [BRAND] Blockchain or [BRAND] Reward.\n8.2 Digital Rewards. \nPlatform Rewards are not considered legal tender, are not issued or backed by any government, and have fewer regulatory protections than traditional currency. Moreover, Platform Rewards are not insured against theft or loss by any insurance corporation or any investor protection, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.\n8.3 Market Risk. \nThe value of NFTs and Platform Rewards are derived from supply and demand in the global marketplace, which can rise or fall independent of any government(fiat) currency, in addition to potential utility on blockchain platforms. Holding NFTs and digital rewards carries exchange rate and other types of risk. The value of NFTs and digital rewards may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange traditional government currency for digital rewards, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular digital reward should the market disappear. The volatility and unpredictability of the price and value of NFTs and digital rewards, relative to government currency, may result in significant loss over a short period of time. [BRAND] cannot guarantee or warrant the value of any NFT, digital reward or blockchain, including the [BRAND] Blockchain and [BRAND] Reward, and explicitly warns the User that that there is no reason to believe that any NFT, digital reward, or blockchain reward will increase in value, and that they may hold no value, decrease in value, or entirely lose value.\n8.4 Regulatory Risk. \nLegislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual NFTs, digital rewards, and blockchain rewards.  The regulatory status of digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions, including but not limited to the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules that will affect digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications.  Such changes could negatively impact the [BRAND] Services in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that any of the above are regulated financial instruments that require registration. [BRAND] may cease any distribution of any of the above, the development of the [BRAND] platform, or any operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental action makes it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so.  The industry in which [BRAND] operates is new, and may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. There can be no assurance that governmental, quasi-governmental, regulatory, or other similar types of authorities (including banking authorities) will not examine the operations of [BRAND] and/or pursue enforcement actions against [BRAND]. Such governmental activities may or may not be specifically targeted at [BRAND]. Such examinations and/or actions may subject [BRAND] to judgments, settlements, fines, or penalties, or cause [BRAND] to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm [BRAND]’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on the [BRAND] Services.\n8.5 Technology Risk. \nVirtual NFT and digital reward transactions may be irreversible. Losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some virtual transactions are deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which may not necessarily be the date or time the user initiated the transaction. The nature of such virtual transactions may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attacks.\n8.6 Changes to [BRAND] Node Network.  \n[BRAND] and User recognize that from time-to-time amendments will be made to the [BRAND] Node Network.  [BRAND] and User both specifically agree that [BRAND] will, from time to time, present the [BRAND] Node Network with proposed amendments (the “Proposed Amendments') that the Node Network will then vote on whether to implement the Proposed Amendments (the “Governance Vote”).  The User understands that the Proposed Amendments will be made at the discretion of [BRAND], and [BRAND] owes the User no duty or obligation to make Proposed Amendments in the User’s best interests.  The User specifically understands that there may come a time when a Proposed Amendment is not in the User’s best interests, financial or otherwise (including, but not limited to a change in the distribution calculation), and in such situations the User has no legal recourse against [BRAND] should any Proposed Amendment be approved and implemented through the Governance Vote.  The User’s only recourse is to vote against said Proposed Amendment.  [BRAND] and the User both agree that one such Proposed Amendment may be to change the specifications, including, but not limited to the internet connection, Random Access Memory, Central Processing Unit requirements, extra space, and any other requirements needed to run the Nodes (the “Specifications”).  [BRAND] and User further agree that while the Specifications may be minimal on the effective date of this Agreement, this is subject to change through the Proposed Amendment and the Governance Vote.   Rewards earned (financial or otherwise) for running a [BRAND] Node are subject to change.  \n9.

THE [BRAND] PARTIES SHALL NOT IN ANY CASE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST OPPORTUNITY COSTS, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF THE [BRAND] PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE. THE [BRAND] PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY CLAIM, LIABILITY OR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE [BRAND] SERVICES OR ANY RELIANCE THEREON.  THE [BRAND] PARTIES ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE OF THE [BRAND] SERVICES, FAILURE OF THE [BRAND] SERVICES TO OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COSTS OF RE-CREATING LOST DATA, OR THE COST OF ANY SUBSTITUTE EQUIPMENT OR PROGRAM.  THE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE [BRAND] PARTIES ARE NOT PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER. THE USER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE AND LIABLE FOR YOUR USE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE [BRAND] SERVICES.  THE USER ACKNOWELDGES THAT THE USER HAS READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS CONDITIONED ON THE USER’S REPRESENTATION THAT THE USER HAS ACCEPTED AND AGREED TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT AND THESE PROVISIONS AND DISCLAIMERS. \n10.2 Unavailability of Relief\nIn the event User sues [BRAND], [BRAND] may not have any assets with which to satisfy a judgment as it is not a centralized, fully capitalized legal entity.  User understands that [BRAND] may effectively be judgment proof.  \n11.
